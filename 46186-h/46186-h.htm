PREFATORY NOTE.
</h2>

<p>
This book is the product of two years
spent in Germany during the great war. It
portrays what has been seen and heard by
an American girl whose primary interest
was in art. She has tried to write without
fear or favor the simple truth as it appeared
to her.

<h2>
GETTING INTO GERMANY IN WAR TIME.
</h2>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_1' name='Page_1'></a></span>Now that America and Germany are at war,
it is not possible for an American to enter
the German Empire. Americans can leave the country
if they wish, but once they are out they cannot
go back in again.
</p>

<p>
Since the first year of the war there has been
only one way of getting into Germany through
Denmark, and that is by way of Warnemünde.
After leaving Copenhagen you ride a long way on
the train, and then the train boards a ferry which
takes you to a little island. At the end of this island
is the Danish frontier, where you are thoroughly
searched to see how much food you are trying to
take into Germany. After this frontier is passed
you ride for a few hours on a boat which carries
you right up to Warnemünde, the German landing-place
and the military customs of Germany.
</p>

<p>
When I went to Germany in October, 1915, the
regulations were not very strict, travelers had only
to show that they had a good reason for going
into the country, and they were searched&mdash;that was
all. But during the two years I was in Germany
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2'>2</a></span>
all this was changed. Now it is very hard for even
a neutral to enter Germany. Neutrals must first
have a visé from the German consul in Denmark.
It takes four days to get this visé, and you must
have your picture taken in six different poses. Also,
you must have a legitimate reason for wanting to
go into the country, and if there is anything the least
suspicious about you, you are not granted a permit
to enter.
</p>

<p>
Travelers entering Germany bring as much food
with them as they can. You are allowed to bring
a moderate amount of tea, coffee, soap, canned milk,
etc.; nine pounds of butter and as much smoked
meat as you can carry. No fresh meat is allowed,
and you must carry the meat yourself as no porters
are allowed around the docks. This is a spy precaution.
</p>

<p>
The butter and meat are bought in Copenhagen
from a licensed firm where it is sealed and the firm
sends the package to the boat for you. You must
be careful not to break the seal before the German
customs are passed. The Danes are very strict about
letting rubber goods out of their country, and one
little German girl I knew was so afraid that the
Danes would take her rubbers away from her, that
she wore them on a hot summer day.
</p>

<p>
The boat which takes passengers to and from
Warnemünde is one day a German boat and the
next day a Danish boat. If you are lucky and make
the trip on the day the Danish boat is running, you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3'>3</a></span>
get a wonderful meal, and if you are unlucky and
strike the German day, you get a poor one. After
getting off the boat, you get your first glimpse of
the German <i><span lang="de_DE">Militär</span></i>, the soldiers at the customs.
</p>

<p>
The travelers are divided into two classes&mdash;those
going to Hamburg and those going to Berlin. Then
a soldier gets up on a box and asks if there is any
one in the crowd who has no passport. The day
I came through only one man stepped forward. I
felt sorry for him, but he did not look the least bit
disheartened. An officer led him away. Strange to
say, four days later we were seated in a hotel in
Berlin eating our breakfast when this same little
man came up and asked if we were not from Pittsburg,
and if we had not come over on the "Kristianiafjord."
When I said that we had, he remarked:
"Well, I am from Pittsburg, too, and I
came over on the 'Kristianiafjord.'"
</p>

<p>
"But I did not see you among the passengers,"
I said.
</p>

<p>
"No," he answered, "I should say not. I was a
bag of potatoes in the hold. I am a reserve officer
in the German army, and I was determined to get
back to fight. I came without a passport claiming
to be a Russian. It took me three days to get fixed
up at Warnemünde because I had no papers of any
kind. The day I had everything straightened out
and was leaving for Berlin, a funny thing happened.
I was walking along the street with an officer when
a crowd of Russian prisoners came along. To my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4'>4</a></span>
surprise one of the fellows yelled at me, 'Hello,
Mister, you'se here too?' And I knew that fellow.
He had worked for my father in America. As he
was returning to Russia, he was taken prisoner by
the Germans. I had an awful time explaining my
acquaintance to the authorities at Warnemünde, but
here I am waiting to join my regiment."
</p>

<p>
At Warnemünde, after the people are divided
into groups, they are taken into a large room where
the baggage is examined. At the time I came
through we were allowed to bring manuscript with
us, but it had to be read. Now not one scrap of
either written or printed matter can be carried, not
even so much as an address. All the writing now
going into Germany must be sent by post and censored
as a letter.
</p>

<p>
When I came through I had a stack of notes with
me and I never dreamed that it would be examined.
I was having a difficult time with the soldier who
was searching me when an officer who spoke perfect
English came up and asked if he could help me.
He had to read all my letters and papers, but he
was such a slow reader that the train was held up
half an hour waiting for him to finish reading them.
Nothing was taken away from me, but they took a
copy of the <i>London Illustrated News</i> away from a
German who protested loudly, waving his hands.
It was a funny thing to do, for in Berlin this paper
was for sale on all the news stands and in the cafés.
But sometimes the Germans make it a point of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5'>5</a></span>
treating foreigners better than they do their own
people. I noticed this many times afterward.
</p>

<p>
After the baggage was examined, the people had
to be searched. The men didn't have to undress
and the women were taken into a small room where
women searchers made us take off all our clothes.
They even make you take off your shoes, they feel
in your hair and they look into your locket. As I
had held up the train so long, I did not have much
time to dress and hurried into the train with my
hat in my hand and my shoes untied. As the train
pulls out the searcher soldiers line up and salute it.
Searching isn't a very nice job, and when my
mother went back to America the next spring, no
less than four of the searchers told her that they
hated it and that when the war was over the whole
Warnemünde force was coming to America.
</p>

<p>
The train was due in Berlin at 9 o'clock at night,
but we were late when we pulled in at the Stettin
Station. We had a hard time getting a cab and
finally we had to share an automobile with a strange
man who was going to the same hotel. At 10 o'clock
we were in our hotel on Unter den Linden. From
the window I could look out on the linden trees.
The lights were twinkling merrily in the cafés across
the way. Policemen were holding up the traffic on
the narrow Friedrichstrasse. People were everywhere.
It did not seem like a country that was
taking part in the great war.

<h2>
SOLDIERS OF BERLIN.
</h2>

<p>
Berlin is a city of soldiers. Every day is
soldiers' day. And on Sundays there are even
more soldiers than on week days. Then Unter den
Linden, Friedrichstrasse and the Tiergarten are
one seething mass of gray coats&mdash;gray the color of
everything and yet the color of nothing. This field
gray blends with the streets, the houses, and the
walls, and the dark clothes of the civilians stand
out conspicuously against this gray mass.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p008i.jpg" width="492" height="329" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>Soldiers Marching Through Brandenburg Gate.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
When I first came to Berlin, I thought it was just
by chance that so many soldiers were there, but the
army seems ever to increase&mdash;officers, privates, sailors
and men right from the trenches. During the
two years that I was in Berlin this army remained
the same. It didn't decrease in numbers and it
didn't change in looks. The day I left Berlin it
looked exactly the same as the day I entered the
country. They were anything but a happy-looking
bunch of men, and all they talked about was, "when
the war is over"; and like every German I met
in those two years, they longed and prayed for
peace. One day on the street car I heard a common
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8'>8</a></span>
German soldier say, "What difference does it
make to us common people whether Germany wins
the war or not, in these three years we folks have
lost everything." But every German soldier is willing
to do his duty.
</p>

<p>
The most wonderful thing about this transit army
is that everything the soldiers have, from their caps
to their shoes, is new, except the soldiers just coming
from the front. And yet as a rule they are not new recruits
starting out, but men who have been home on
a furlough or men who have been wounded and are
now ready to start back to the front. To believe
that Germany has exhausted her supply of men is
a mistake. Personally, I know lots of young Germans
that have never been drafted. The most of
these men are such who, for some reason or other,
have had no army service, and the German military
believe that one trained man is worth six untrained
men, and it is the trained soldier that is always kept
in the field. If he has been wounded he is quickly
hurried back to the front. By their scientific methods
a bullet wound can be entirely cured in six
weeks.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p010i.jpg" width="480" height="287" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>The Most Popular Post-Card in Germany.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
German men have never been noted dressers, and
even at their best the middle and lower classes look
very gawky and countrified in civilian clothes. You
cannot imagine how the uniform improves their appearance.
I have seen new recruits marching to
the place where they get their uniforms. Most of
them have on old ill-fitting clothes, slouch hats and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10'>10</a></span>
polished boots. They shuffle along, carrying boxes
and bundles. They have queer embarrassed looks
on their faces. Three hours later, this same lot
of men come forth. They are not the same men.
They have a different fire in their eyes, they hold
themselves straighter, they no longer slouch but
keep step. The uniform seems to have made new
men of them. It should be called "transform," not
uniform.
</p>

<p>
At the Friedrichstrasse Station one can see every
kind of soldiers at once. There the men arrive from
the front sometimes covered with dust and mud,
and once I saw a man with his trousers all spattered
with blood. The common soldiers carry everything
with them. On their backs they have their knapsacks,
and around their waists they have cans,
spoons, bundles and all sorts of things. These men
carry sixty-five pounds with them all the time. In
one of their bags they carry what is known as their
<i><span lang="de_DE">eiserne Portion</span></i> or their "iron portion." This consists
of two cans of meat, two cans of vegetables,
three packages of hard tack, ground coffee for several
meals and a flask of whisky. The soldiers are
not allowed to eat this portion unless they are in a
place where no food can be brought to them, and
then they are only allowed to eat it at the command
of a superior officer. In the field the iron portions
are inspected each day, and any soldier that has
touched his portion is severely punished.
</p>

</div>

<p>
A great many of the soldiers have the Iron Cross
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12'>12</a></span>
of the second class, but very rarely a cross of the
first class is seen. The second class cross is not
worn but is designated by a black and white ribbon
drawn through the buttonhole. The first class cross
is worn pinned rather low on the coat. The order
<i>Pour le mérite</i> is the highest honor in the German
army, and not a hundred of them have been given
out since the beginning of the war. It is a blue,
white and gold cross and is hung from the wearer's
collar. A large sum of money goes with this decoration.
The second class Iron Cross makes the
owner exempt from certain taxes; and five marks
each month goes with the first class Iron Cross.
</p>

<p>
The drilling-grounds for soldiers are very interesting.
Most of these places are inclosed, but the
one at the <span lang="de_DE">Grunewald</span> was open, and I often used
to go there to see the soldiers. It made a wonderful
picture&mdash;the straight rows of drilling men with the
tall forest for a background. The men were usually
divided off into groups, a corporal taking twelve men
to train. It was fun watching the new recruits learning
the goose-step. The poor fellows tried so hard
they looked as though they would explode, but if
they did not do it exactly right, they were sent back
to do it over again. The trainers were not the least
bit sympathetic.
</p>

<p>
One day an American boy and I went to Potsdam.
We were standing in front of the old Town Palace
watching some fresh country boys drill. I laughed

He was so serious and so funny I couldn't
help it. The corporal came over to us and ordered
us to leave the grounds, which we meekly did.

It is very interesting to watch the troop trains
coming in from the front. When I first went to
Berlin it was all a novelty to me and I spent a great
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16'>16</a></span>
deal of my time at the stations. One night just
before Christmas, 1915, the first Christmas I was
in Berlin, I spent three hours at the Anhalt Station
watching the troops come home. They were
very lucky, these fellows, six months in the trenches
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17'>17</a></span>
and then to be home at Christmas time! They were
the happiest people I had seen in the war unless
it were the people who came to meet them.

</p>
</div>

<p>
Most of the soldiers were sights. Their clothes
were dirty, torn and wrinkled. Many of them coming
from Russia were literally covered with a white
dust. At first I thought that they were bakers, but
when I saw several hundred of them I changed my
mind. Beside his regular paraphernalia, each soldier
had a dozen or more packages. The packages
were strapped on everywhere, and one little fellow
had a bundle stuck on the point of his helmet.
</p>

<p>
A little child, perhaps three years old, was being
held over the gate near me and all the while he kept
yelling, "Papa! <i><span lang="de_DE">Urlaub</span></i>!" An <i><span lang="de_DE">Urlaub</span></i> is a furlough,
and when the father did come at last the child
screamed with delight. Another soldier was met
by his wife and a tiny little baby. He took the little
one in his arms, and the tears rolled down his
cheeks, "My baby that I have never seen," he said.
</p>

<p>
This night the soldiers came in crowds. Everybody
was smiling, and in between the trains we went
into the station restaurant. At every table sat a
soldier and his friends. One young officer had been
met by his parents, and he was so taken up with his
mother that he could not sit down but he hung over
her chair. Was she happy? Well, I should say so!
</p>

<p>
At another table sat a soldier and his sweetheart.
They did not care who saw them, and can you blame
them? He patted her cheeks and he kissed her hand....
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18'>18</a></span>
An old man who sat at the table pretended that
he was reading, and he tried to look the other way,
but at last he could hold himself no longer, and
grasping the soldier's hand he cried, "<i><span lang="de_DE">Mahlzeit!</span></i>"

A little old lady stood beside us. She was
a pale little lady dressed in black. She was so eager.
She strained her eyes and watched every face in the
crowd. It was bitter cold and she was thinly clad. At
12 o'clock the station master announced that there
would be no more trains until morning. The little
old lady turned away. I watched her bent figure
as she went down the stairs. She was pulling out
her handkerchief.

<h2>
THE WOMEN WORKERS OF BERLIN.
</h2>

<p>
The German women have filled in the ranks
made vacant by the men. Nothing is too difficult
for them to undertake and nothing is too hard
for them to do.
</p>

<p>
The poor German working women! No one in
all the war has suffered like these poor creatures.
Their men have been taken from them, they are
paid only a few pfennigs a day by the government,
and now they must work, work like a man, work
like a horse.
</p>

<p>
The German working woman is tremendously capable
in manual labor. She never seems to get tired
and she can stand all day in the wet and snow.
But as a wife and mother she is becoming spoiled.
She is bound to become rough, and she takes the
jostlings of the men she meets with good grace,
answering their flip remarks, joking with them and
giving them a physical blow when she thinks it
necessary. Most of the women seem to like this
familiarity which working on the streets brings
them, and they find it much more exciting than
doing housework at home.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21'>21</a></span>
</p>

<p>
All great reforms begin in a violent way, and
maybe this is the beginning of emancipation for
the German woman, for she is beginning to realize
what she can do, and for the first time in the history
of the empire she is living an independent existence,
dependent upon no man.

<p>
When the war first broke out, women were taken
on as ticket punchers on the overground and underground
railways, and <i><span lang="de_DE">Frau Kneiperin</span></i>, or "Mrs.
Ticket-puncher," sits all day long out in the open,
punching tickets. In summer this job is very pleasant,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22'>22</a></span>
but in winter she gets very, very cold even if
she does wear a thick heavy overcoat and thick
wooden shoes over her other shoes. She can't wear
gloves for she must take each ticket in her hand in
order to punch the stiff boards. She earns three
marks a day.

<p>
After the women ticket punchers came the women
door shutters, and <i><span lang="de_DE">Frau Türschliesserin</span></i>, or "Mrs.
Door Shutter," is all day long on the platforms of
the stations, and she must see that every train door
is shut before the train starts. This is a lively job,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23'>23</a></span>
and she must jump from one door to the other. Most
of these women wear bloomers, but some of them
wear men's trousers tucked in their high boots. They
all wear caps and badges.
</p>

<p>
<i><span lang="de_DE">Frau Briefträgerin</span></i> is the woman letter carrier.
This is rather a nice job, carrying only a little bag
of letters. One fault with the work is that she must
deliver the letters to the top floor of every building
whether there is an elevator or not, but as no German
building is more than five stories high, it is
not so bad. Most of the special delivery "boys"
are women. They wear a boy's suit and ride a
bicycle.
</p>

<p>
More than half the street car conductors in Germany
now are women. Most of these women still
cling to skirts, but they all wear a man's cap and
coat. They are quite expert at climbing on the
back of the car and fixing the trolley, and if necessary
they can climb on the top of the car. If the
car gets stuck, they get out and push it, but the
crowd is generally ready to help them. They have
their bag for tips, and they expect their five pfennigs
extra the same as a man.
</p>

<p>
When <i><span lang="de_DE">Frau Führerin</span></i>, or "Mrs. Motorman,"
came, some of the German people were scandalized
and exclaimed: "Well, I will never ride on a
street car run by a woman. It wouldn't be safe."
Now, no one thinks anything about it, and the
women have no more accidents than the men. Some
of these women are little bits of things, and one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24'>24</a></span>
wonders that they have the strength to stand it all
day long. Most of them look as if it were nerve-racking.
They earn three and a half marks a day.

<p>
Women cab drivers are not very numerous, but
every now and then one of them whizzes around a
corner looking for a fare. One Berlin cabby is
quite an old lady. The men cabbies are jealous of
the women because the women get the best tips.
There are few women taxi drivers. One young
woman driver has a whole leather suit with tight
breeches and an aviator hat. Women also drive
mail wagons, and women go around from one store
to another cleaning windows. <i><span lang="de_DE">Frau Fensterputzerin</span></i>
or "Mrs. Window Cleaner" carries a heavy ladder
with her. This is no light task.
</p>

<p>
They have always had women street cleaners and
switch tenders in Munich, but now they have them in
Berlin as well. They work in groups, sweeping the
dirt and hauling it away in wheelbarrows. Just before
I left Berlin I saw a woman posting bills on the round
advertising posts. She did not seem to be an expert
at managing the paste, because she flung it around
so that it was dangerous to come near her. In the
last year they have had women track walkers, and
they pace the railroad ties to see if the tracks are
safe. They dress in blue and carry small iron canes.

<p>
The excavation for the new underground railway
under Friedrichstrasse was dug out by women, and
half the gangs that work on the railroad tracks are
women. They fasten bolts and saw the iron rails.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26'>26</a></span>
All the stores have women elevator runners, and
most of the large department stores have women
checking umbrellas, packages, dogs, and&mdash;lighted
cigars! Most stores have women floor-walkers.
Most of the delivery wagons are run by women, and
they carry the heaviest packages.
</p>

<p>
All the newspapers in Berlin are sold by women,
and they wheel the papers around in baby carriages.
Around the different freight stations one can see
women loading hay and straw into the cars. They
wield the pitchfork with as much ease as a man
and with far more grace. Many of the "brakemen"
on the trains are women, and some of the train
conductors are women. Most of the gas-meter
readers are women, and other women help to repair
telephone wires, and still others help to instal telephones.
</p>

<p>
There are a few <i><span lang="de_DE">Frau Schornsteinfegerin</span></i>, or
"Mrs. Chimney Sweep," but the job of being a
chimneysweep doesn't appeal to most women. These
women wear trousers and a tight-fitting cap. They
mount the house tops and they make the soot fly,
and the cement rattles down the chimney. They
carry long ropes with which they pull their brushes
up and down.

<p>
<i><span lang="de_DE">Frau Klempnermeisterin</span></i>, or "Mrs. Master Tinner,"
repairs the roofs. Of course she wears trousers
to make climbing easier. Most of the women
who have these odd jobs are those whose husbands
had the same before the war. Many other women
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28'>28</a></span>
work in the parks cutting the grass and watering
the flowers. In the market places women put rubber
heels on your shoes while you wait.
</p>

<p>
Most of the milk wagons are run by girls, and
women help to deliver coal. They have no coal
chutes in Germany, and the coal is carried from the
wagon into the house. This is really terrible work
for a woman. A few women work on ash wagons,
others are "ice men," and others build houses.
</p>

<p>
Nearly all the munition workers in Germany are
women, and they are paid very high for this work.
Most of them get from $40 to $50 a month, wages
before unknown for working women. The strength
of some of these women is almost beyond belief.
Dr. Gertrude Baumer, the famous German woman
writer and settlement worker, told me that shells
made in one factory weighed eighty pounds each
and that every day the women working lifted thirty-six
of these shells. Women are also employed in
polishing the shells.
</p>

<p>
The women workers in munition factories are
very closely watched, and if the work does not agree
with them they are taken away and are given other
employment. The sanitary conditions of these factories
are very good, and they are almost fire-proof,
and they have no horrible fire disasters. Indeed they
have very few fires in Germany.
</p>

<p>
They have in Berlin what is known as the <i><span lang="de_DE">Nationaler
Frauendienst</span></i>, or the "National Women's Service,"
and it is an organization to help the poor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30'>30</a></span>
women of Germany during the war. Dr. Gertrude
Baumer is the president of this organization, and
she is also one of the strongest advocates for the
one year army service for German women.

This society finds employment for women and
gives out work for women who have little children
and cannot leave home. Women who sew at home
make bags for sand defenses, and they make helmet
covers of gray cloth. These covers keep the enemy
from seeing the shining metal of the helmet. If a
woman is sick and cannot work the society takes
care of her until she is better and able to work again.
They also have food tickets which they give to the
poor.

Pension schedules are being made up by different
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32'>32</a></span>
societies, and it is not yet certain which one the
government will adopt; at present every woman
whose husband is in the war is given a certain
amount for herself and children. For women who
are now widows the pension is according to the rank
of the husband. For instance, the widow of a common
soldier gets 300 marks a year. If she has one
child she get 568 marks and so on, increasing according
to the number of children, for four children
she gets 1072 marks. The widow of a non-commissioned
officer, a corporal or a sergeant, gets a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33'>33</a></span>
little more, and the widow of a lieutenant gets over
twice as much as a common soldier's widow. The
widow of a major-general gets 3246 marks a year.
When she has children, she gets very little more,
for when a man has risen to the rank of major-general
the chances are that he is old and that his
children are grown up and able to take care of themselves.

<p>
These schedules are also controlled by the number
of years a man has served in the army, and they
are trying to pass a new bill which requires that
pensions shall be controlled by the salary the man
had before the war. If the dead man had worked
himself up into a good position of 1000 marks a
month, his family should have more than the family
of a man who could only make 300 marks a month.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34'>34</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The schedule as it now stands for wounded men
is that a private who has lost his leg gets 1,368
marks a year; a lieutenant gets 4851 marks a year;
and a general 10,332 marks a year.

<p>
When the blockade of Germany began, no
one believed that she could hold out without
supplies from the outside world; that in a short
time her people would be starving and that she
would be out of raw material. During the few
months before the blockade was declared, Germany
had shipped into her ports as much cotton, copper,
rubber and food as was possible. After the blockade
started much stuff was obtained from Holland and
Scandinavia. From the very first days of the war
Germany set to work to utilize all the material that
she had on hand, and her watchword to her people
was "waste nothing."

<p>
The first collection of material in Germany was
a metal collection, and it took place in the fall of
1915, just after I came to Berlin. This collection
extended all over Germany and took place in different
parts at different times. Every family received
a printed notice of the things that must be
given up to the State. It was a long list, but the
main thing on it was the brass ovendoors. As nearly
every room in Germany has a stove with two of these
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36'>36</a></span>
doors about a foot wide and three quarters of a foot
high you can get some idea of how much material
this collection brought. Since this collection the doors
have been replaced by iron ones that are not nearly
so pretty. All kinds of brass pots and kettles were
collected, but with special permits people were allowed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37'>37</a></span>
to keep their heirlooms. Everything was paid
for by the weight, artistic value counted for naught.
Vacant stores were rented for storing this collection
and the people had to bring the things there.
</p>

<p>
In some cities the people willingly gave up the
copper roofs of their public buildings. Copper roofs
have always been very popular in Germany. In
Berlin the roof of the palace, the cathedral and the
Reichstag building are of copper, and in Dresden
the roofs of all the royal buildings are of copper.
</p>

<p>
A friend of mine who is a Catholic went to church
one Sunday just before I left Berlin. Before the
service opened and just as the priest mounted the
pulpit the church bells began to ring. When they
had stopped the priest announced that this was the
last time the bells would ever ring, for they were
to be given to the metal collection. The people
began to cry as the priest went on, and before he
had finished, many were sobbing out loud. Even
the men wept. My friend said that it was the most
impressive thing that she had ever witnessed.
</p>

<p>
In that first copper collection they got enough
metal to last several years, but if a second collection
is necessary they can take the brass door knobs
which are very large and heavy. All the door
knobs in Germany are made of brass and this would
make a vast amount of metal.

<p>
In April, 1917, they took an inventory of all the
aluminum in the empire. People had to send in
lists of what they had. The ware was not collected
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38'>38</a></span>
but it was to be given up at any time the government
wanted it. The aluminum is to be used in
making money. For a long time they have had
iron 5- and 10-pfennig pieces, and now they have
1-pfennig pieces made out of aluminum. In Leipsic
and Dresden they have 50-pfennig pieces made out
of paper, and Berlin will soon have them too. Before
the iron money was made in the winter of 1915,
small change was very scarce. The store-keepers
would rather you would not buy than give you all
their small change. At that time in Turkey also
small change was so scarce that the people stood in
line by the hour to get it. The reason for the
scarcity in Germany is that the German soldiers
have carried it away to the conquered lands where
German money is used as well as native money. In
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39'>39</a></span>
Germany we used, and they still use, postage stamps
for small change, but this is very unsatisfactory
as they get very dirty in the handling.

The collection of old paper never ceases in Germany.
All over Berlin they have places where this
paper is accumulated and sold, and women work all
day bringing it in. Every kind of old paper is
bought, books, magazines and newspapers. Everything
must be brought in flat, and a good price is
paid for it.
</p>

<p>
Another collection that is always going on is the
fruit stone collection. They collect cherry stones,
peach stones, plum stones, and apple and pear seeds.
These collections take place in the public schools
and all over Berlin you see pretty posters, "Send
the stones to the schoolhouse with your children."
The seeds are used for making fat and oil.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40'>40</a></span>

Everybody wondered what they were going to do
when they advertised that fourteen marks would be
paid for every load of common thistles. But the
thistles are being made into cloth. Hair is also made
into cloth. Coffee grounds are also collected, but
it has not been decided how they shall be used.
</p>

<p>
When the clocks are changed in the summer, it
saves a great amount of gas, and since the first of
January, 1917, all the stores must close at 7 o'clock
instead of 8. All electric light advertisements are
prohibited, and all theaters and public places close
earlier.

<p>
In the city of Hanover, on account of the scarcity
of water, the water is shut off from the bath rooms,
and no one can take a bath. In Copenhagen there
is also a scarcity of water, and when I was there
the water all over the city was shut off between two
and four o'clock in the afternoon.

This coming winter people will be urged in every
way to save coal, and if possible to heat only one
or two rooms. They have plenty of coal but no way
of delivering it, and last winter people had to go
down to the freight yards and fetch the coal themselves.
I often saw fine-looking ladies wheeling
coal in baby carriages. Baby carriages are used
for hauling everything, and they are very practical.
</p>

<p>
In every way paper is being saved, especially
wrapping paper. Every woman has her bun bag,
and when she goes to the bakery shop to buy buns
she takes it with her. I have seen men buying buns
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41'>41</a></span>
in stores, and they nearly always have their own
paper bag with them. Bread is just wrapped in the
middle of the loaf, and if you don't take your own
bag with you for eggs, you will have to carry them
home in your hand.
</p>

<p>
In the markets nothing is wrapped. Every German
woman has what she calls her <i>Tasche</i>. It is a
black bag with handles and it is used in preference
to a basket. Everything that is bought in the market
is put into this bag unwrapped. If you buy
anything that is too large to put into the bag you
have to carry it home in your hand unwrapped.
Rhubarb is carried in this way. Meat is first wrapped
in a thin piece of wax paper and then in a newspaper.
Wherever it is possible, newspapers are
used for wrappings. We were never fussy about
carrying a newspaper bundle in Germany, we were
glad we got the newspaper. One night a friend of
mine, an American girl, came to stay all night with
me, and as we had only two quilts, she had to bring
her own quilt with her. She had no paper big
enough to wrap the quilt, so she just carried it in
her hand. The people on the street car and on the
street did not even stare, they merely thought that
she was a good German woman who was sparing
of paper for the Vaterland.

<p>
In the department stores they do not use string
on small packages, and on large packages they tie
the string only one way around. If the purchase
is a very small object like a spool of thread or a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42'>42</a></span>
paper of pins, it is wrapped in the bill. Many people
carry their own wrapping paper with them and it
is always wise to carry a piece of string. None of
the department stores will deliver anything that
costs less than five marks, and notices are posted
everywhere asking people to carry their purchases
home with them. Only one store, Borchardt's grocery
store, still wraps up things as nicely as in days
of peace, and when you buy anything there you are
sure that the package will not come open on the
street. Now they have invented a new kind of
string made out of wood. It is very strong but hard
to tie.
</p>

<p>
Since the very beginning of the war no one in
Germany has been allowed to run his own automobile
on account of the scarcity of rubber tires and
gasoline. All the automobiles displayed in the store
windows have tires made of cement. This is just
done to make them look better. All the tires have
been taken over by the military authorities. No
one is allowed to ride a bicycle with rubber tires
without a permit. They have invented two kinds
of tires for substitutes. One kind is made of little
disks of leather joined in the middle, and the other
kind is made of coiled wire. Both these tires are
advertised, and the advertisements read: "Don't
worry, ride your bicycle in war time. Get a leather
disk tire; then you don't need a permit."
</p>

<p>
For everything that is scarce in Germany they
have a substitute and in this line German ingenuity
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44'>44</a></span>
seems to have no end. They have a substitute for
milk called <i>Milfix</i>. It is a white powder, and when
mixed with water it looks like milk. It can be used
in coffee or for cooking. The funny part about
<i>Milfix</i> was that when it first came out everybody
scorned it, but all of a sudden there was hardly any
real milk to be had, and <i>Milfix</i> was put on the
<i><span lang="de_DE">Lebensmittel</span></i> food card, and one could only buy a
small quantity of it. Then everybody was just wild
to get a little bit of the precious stuff.
</p>

<p>
Then they have egg substitutes. Some brands of
it are in powder form and other brands are like
yellow capsules. They are very good when mixed
with one real egg and make very good omelet. Then
there is the meat substitute. It comes in cans and
is dark brown in color. It is some kind of a prepared
vegetable. It looks like chopped meat and
it is said to taste like meat. They have a hundred
different varieties of substitutes for coffee, and without
any exception all brands of <i><span lang="de_DE">Kaffee-Ersatz</span></i> are
very bad.
</p>

<p>
The most unique thing on the market is the "butter
stretcher." That is what they call it. It is a
white powder, and they guarantee that when it is
mixed with a quarter of a pound of real butter it
will stretch it to half a pound. We bought some of
it but we never had the courage to try it on a quarter
of a pound of real butter; but many boarding-houses
used it.
</p>

<p>
Every day something new bobbed up on the market.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45'>45</a></span>
One of the finest things was <i><span lang="de_DE">Butter-Brühe</span></i>
and <i><span lang="de_DE">Schmalz-Brühe</span></i>. It came in cans the half of
which was either butter or lard and the other half
was broth. It was fixed this way so it did not come
under the butter card or the fat card. The cans
weighed a half pound and sold for five marks. It
was foreign goods from either Holland or Denmark.
</p>

<p>
Last spring there appeared on the market great
quantities of "Irish stew" in cans. The Germans
stood around it wondering. What was Irish stew?
None of them had the slightest idea. But finally
they bought it, for they said, if it was Irish it must
be good. They have a substitute for sausage made
out of fish. It is awful stuff with a lingering taste
that lasts for days.
</p>

<p>
They have substitutes for leather, rubber, and
for alcohol. They have what they call a <i><span lang="de_DE">spiritus</span></i>
tablet, and it can be used in lamps. It is used by
the soldiers in the field. As matches are very expensive
they have a small apparatus of two iron
pieces that when snapped make a light. As soap
is very scarce in Germany hard-wood floors are
cleaned with tin shavings. The shavings are rubbed
over the floors with the feet, the workers wearing
felt shoes.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</p>
</div>

<p>
All over Germany soap is used very sparingly.
Clothes are put to soak a week before wash day
and each day they are boiled a little. This plan
saves all the hard rubbing, and when the clothes
are taken out of the water the dirt falls out of them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46'>46</a></span>
They don't use wash-boards in Germany. Pasted
everywhere in Berlin are posters which say, "Save
the soap." They say to shake the soap in hot water
and never let it lie in the water and always keep it
in a dry place.
</p>

<p>
Most stores will sell only one spool of embroidery
floss to one person at a time. If you want a second
spool you must go the next day. This restriction
is very hard on the German woman who loves to do
fancy work.
</p>

<p>
We saved everything. When we boiled potatoes
we saved the water for soup or gravy. It had more
strength than clear water. We never ate eggs out
of fancy dishes with grooves in them, as too much
of the egg stuck in the grooves. We served everything
from the cooking kettle right on our plates,
so that no grease would be wasted. Many restaurants
also did this, and what you ordered was
brought in on the plate that you ate from. A great
many people used paper napkins for every day. This
saved the linen and the soap. We never threw out
our coffee grounds but cooked them over and over.
We weren't used to strong coffee, and these warmed-over
grounds were much better than <i><span lang="de_DE">Kaffee-Ersatz</span></i>.
</p>

<p>
Some people cooked rhubarb tops in the same
way you cook spinach. It makes a very good vegetable.
We took the pea pods from the fresh peas
and scraped them and cooked them with the peas.
These are really fine. It is a well-known Polish
dish. The first year we were in Berlin we could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48'>48</a></span>
get corn starch, and we used this for thickening
food instead of flour.
</p>

<p>
One of the funniest things was that you could
not buy an orange unless you bought a lemon. This
worked two ways. The oranges were saved and
the storekeepers got rid of the lemons. I have never
seen anything like the quantity of lemons in Germany&mdash;millions
of lemons everywhere. Lemons,
radishes and onions were three things that you could
buy any time without a card and without standing
in line.
</p>

<p>
Since the war, hundreds of war cook books have
been printed. They are generally very practical
and give excellent recipes for making cakes without
butter or eggs or even flour, using oatmeal instead.
They tell how to make soup out of plums, apples,
pears, onions and fish. And they contain menus
with suggestions of things to have on the meatless
days. They save the puzzled housewife's brain
much worry.
</p>

<p>
Last Christmas in Germany was known as the
Christmas of a single candle, and most of the Christmas
trees had only one light on the top. One has
no idea of the tremendous sacrifices these people
are making for their country.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49'>49</a></span>

<h2>
THE FOOD IN GERMANY.
</h2>

<p>
In Germany I sometimes had to go to three or
four different stores before I could get a spool
of silk thread. Leather is so expensive that only
the upper-class burgher will be able to have real
leather shoes this winter; and starch is twenty
marks a pound. But after all, no German will go
to work with an empty dinner pail.
</p>

<p>
The German Food Commission is the most uncanny
thing in all the world. Like magic it produces
a substitute for any article that is scarce, it
has everything figured out so that provisioning
shall be divided proportionately each week, and just
what each person shall receive, for everybody does
not receive the same amount of food in Germany.
For instance, a man or woman who does manual
labor gets more bread than a man or woman who
works in an office; people over sixty years get more
cereals, and sick people get more butter and eggs.
These people get what they call <i><span lang="de_DE">Zusatz</span></i> cards, besides
their regular cards.
</p>

<p>
Every one in Germany is getting thin, and the
German dieting system proves that much worn-out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50'>50</a></span>
statement that "we eat too much," for nine out of
every ten Germans have never been so well in their
lives as they have been since the cards have been
introduced. You feel spry, active and energetic,
and the annoyance is mental rather than physical,
for one is constantly thinking of things to eat.
</p>

<p>
The ones that are really hurt by the blockade are
the growing children, and the thing that they lack
and long for is sweets. Before the war, one never
realized what an important role candy played in
the game of life. The food commission recognizes
this, and very often chocolate and puddings are
given on the cards of children under sixteen years
of age.
</p>

<p>
While food prices have been soaring all over the
world, prices in Germany are almost down to normal
level, for anything that you buy on the cards
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51'>51</a></span>
is extremely cheap, and everything that is any good
is sold on the cards. Everything that is sold <i><span lang="de_DE">ohne
Karte</span></i>, or without a card, is either not good or so
expensive that the ordinary person cannot afford
to buy.
</p>

<p>
When I first came to Germany in October, 1915,
there was only one card, and that was the bread
card. This card was divided off in sections with
the numbers 25, 50 and 100 grams. At that time
the whole card was 2100 grams for each person
each week. Later it was reduced to 1900 grams,
and on the first of May, 1917, to 1600 grams.
This last reduction was a courageous thing for the
bread commission to do at this time&mdash;one of the
worst months of the year before the green vegetables
come in&mdash;and in Berlin a couple of thousand
workers from a factory gathered on Unter den Linden.
They stayed two hours, broke two windows,
and then went home pacified at a pound of meat a
week more and more wages.
</p>

<p>
On the bread card it takes a 50 gram section to
buy a good-sized roll, a whole card to buy a big
loaf of black bread, and half a card to buy a small
loaf of bread. After the bread card was reduced
no buns were allowed to be made in Berlin, although
in the other cities they have them. Instead, they
had what they called white bread, but it was almost
as black as the black bread, and when buying one
had to ask, "Is this white or black bread?" I thought
that the bread was very good, and it was of a much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52'>52</a></span>
superior quality to what I got in Sweden where the
bread card is of a less number of grams than in
Germany. At the bottom of the German bread card
is the flour ticket, and it allows one the choice of
either 250 grams of flour or 400 grams of bread.
I came out very well on my bread card, for even
when I lived in a boarding-house I kept my card
myself and I took my bread to the table with me.
When people are invited to a meal they always take
their bread and butter with them.
</p>

<p class="caption">
<i>A Store in Charlottenburg, a Suburb of Berlin.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
After the bread card the next food restriction
was the two meatless and fatless days a week. On
Tuesday and Friday no butcher was allowed to
sell meat, and no restaurants or boarding-houses
were allowed to serve meat. Monday and Thursday
were the fatless days. The butchers were not
allowed to sell fat, and the restaurants were not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53'>53</a></span>
allowed to cook anything in grease. On Wednesday
no pork was allowed to be sold.
</p>

<p>
Until after Christmas there were no other cards,
but along in December the butter began to be scarce,
and the stores would sell only a half pound to each
person, and the people had to stand in line to get
that half pound. These butter lines were controlled
by the police, and it was no joke standing out in the
cold to get a half pound of butter. But after Christmas
came in rapid succession the butter card, the
meat card, the milk card, the egg card, the soap
card and the grocery card. These cards have regulated
everything and have stopped the standing in
line for articles.
</p>

<p>
At first the butter card called for half a pound
of butter each week, but now it varies. Then it
wasn't a separate card, but the center of the bread
card was stamped for butter. Now each person
gets either 60 grams of butter and 30 grams of
margarine, or 80 grams of butter. You must buy
your butter in a certain shop where you are registered
and you can buy no place else. This is also
true of sugar, meat, eggs and potatoes.
</p>

<p>
At first the meat card was only for home buyers,
and the restaurants could serve as much meat as they
liked, but soon it was seen that this was not fair
to the people who eat at home. A card was issued
that was divided off into little sections, so that the
meat could be bought all at once or at different
times. On the first of May, 1917, the meat card was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54'>54</a></span>
increased by one-half, and every one is getting 750
grams of meat instead of 500 grams. Here the food
commission made a mistake: they should have given
out more meat in the cold months and have kept
more flour for spring, but instead they increased the
meat card in May and lowered the bread card.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p054i.jpg" width="372" height="268" alt="" />
<p class="caption">
<i>One of the First Bread-Cards.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Another mistake that the food commission is
making is allowing scandalous prices to be charged
for fowls. Fish, chickens, geese and turkeys are
bought without cards, but the prices are so high
that few people can afford to buy them, and the
birds are lying rotting in the store windows. Those
birds are undrawn to make them weigh more. A
medium-sized turkey or goose costs anywhere from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55'>55</a></span>
sixty to one hundred marks, and a chicken runs
about thirty marks.
</p>

<p>
The milk card was among the first cards, and
only sick people and children get milk. The babies
get the best milk and the older children get the next
best, and after they are served the grown-ups get
what is left. Adults have no milk card.
</p>

<p>
The sugar card varies, but one gets about 1¾
pounds of sugar each month. At preserving time
people are given extra sugar and saccharine on the
grocery card. The potato card varies. First it
was seven pounds a week for each person, then it
was reduced to five and then to three, and then it
was raised to five again. This was the only card
on which we sometimes did not get our allowance,
and when there were not enough potatoes for the
cards we could get extra bread on our potato card.
At first some of the potato cards were red and
others blue. The red cards were good on Monday,
Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, and the blue ones
were good on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and
Sunday. Now no potatoes are allowed to be put
into the bread.
</p>

<p>
The egg card came in the summer of 1916, and
for a long time afterward it was possible to get all
the eggs you wanted in restaurants without a card,
but now one must have a card there as well, even
if you order an omelet or an <i><span lang="de_DE">Eierkuchen</span></i>, a pancake
of which the Germans are very fond.
</p>

<p>
The <i><span lang="de_DE">Lebensmittel</span></i> or "grocery" card is a very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56'>56</a></span>
important card, and it is for buying such things as
noodles, rice, barley, oatmeal, macaroni, white cornmeal
and cheese. Then they have other cards for
buying oil, saccharine, matches, sardines and smoked
fish. Fresh fish is without a card. Each week the
stores have numbers hanging up in their windows
telling what can be bought that week, like "Rice on
Number 13" or a "Pudding on Number 6." It is
also printed in the newspapers and on the advertising
posts, and sometimes you must be registered
for the things and can buy them only in a certain
store.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
On the first soap cards, you could get every
month a cake of toilet soap, a cake of laundry soap
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57'>57</a></span>
and some soap powder, but now one can get only
50 grams of either kind of soap and 250 grams of
soap powder each month. Soap was one of the
hardest things to get, and a cake of real soap sells
from five to ten marks a cake. We never thought
of taking a bath with soap but used it only on our
faces. They have what they call "War Soap," and
it can be used on the hands, but if it drops on your
dress it leaves a white spot. If you want to give
a real swell present to any one in Germany just
send a cake of soap.
</p>

<p>
I always said that when coffee came to an end in
Germany the Germans would be ready to make any
kind of a peace. How could a German live without
coffee? But last summer the coffee gave out and
instead of complaining they took to drinking <i><span lang="de_DE">Kaffee-Ersatz</span></i>,
or "coffee substitute," with the same passion
that they had lavished on real coffee. It is
the most horrible stuff any one ever tasted with the
exception of the substitute they have for tea, but
the Germans say they like it. They have cards for
<i><span lang="de_DE">Kaffee-Ersatz</span></i>, and each person gets a half pound
a month.
</p>

<p>
In the cafés in the summer of 1916 they were still
serving real coffee with milk and sugar. Then
suddenly the waiters commenced asking the patrons
if they wished their coffee black or with cream, and
then later they asked if you wanted the coffee sweet,
and so they brought it, putting in sugar and milk
themselves. A little later you did not get sugar
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58'>58</a></span>
but two little pieces of saccharine were served, and
now they have a liquid sweet stuff that is used. They
do not serve real coffee any more, but most restaurants
still serve milk. The famous <i><span lang="de_DE">Kaffee mélange</span></i>,
or coffee with whipped cream, was forbidden
at the beginning of the war.
</p>

<p>
When I left Germany they had no beer or tobacco
cards, but there was talk about them. The beer restaurants
receive only a certain amount of beer each
day, and when this is gone the people must wait
until the next day. Most beer halls serve only two
glasses to each person. In Munich, because of the
shortage of beer, some of the beer halls do not open
until 6 o'clock at night, and at 4 o'clock the Müncheners
gather at the doors with their mugs in their
hands, patiently waiting. Sometimes they knock
the mugs against the doors to a tune. Munich
without beer is a very sad sight!
</p>

<p>
In Berlin some of the restaurants will serve beer
only to people who can get chairs, but this does not
faze the clever Berliners, and when they want their
beer they bring camp stools with them, and then
they are sure to have a seat. It is forbidden to
make certain kinds of fine beers because they take
too much malt and sugar. None of the beer is as
good as in times of peace, but the Germans have forgotten
the delicacies of the past, and they live in
the food ideals of the present, and they smack their
lips and say, "Isn't the beer fine to-night?"
</p>

<p>
From August 1916 until March 1917 it was forbidden
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59'>59</a></span>
to sell canned vegetables. They were being
saved up for the spring months. The store windows
were decorated with glass jars filled with the
most wonderful kinds of peas, beans and asparagus.
I always felt like smashing the window and stealing
the stuff, but the Germans only looked at it admiringly
and said, "It will be fine when the vegetables
are freed."
</p>

<p>
Everything on the cards is at a set price, and the
dealers don't dare to charge one cent more; even
the prices of some things not on the cards are regulated.
For instance, this spring no one could charge
more than one mark a pound for cherries, and many
of the cafés had to cut their cake prices. The police
got after Kranzler, the famous cake house, and
it had to reduce all its cakes to twenty pfennigs each.
</p>

<p>
When I was in Dresden in May, 1917, I ate elephant
meat. An elephant got hurt in the Zoo and
had to be killed. A beer restaurant bought his meat
for 7000 marks, and it was served with sauerkraut
to the public without a card at 1.30 marks. It tasted
like the finest kind of chopped meat, and the restaurant
was packed as long as the elephant lasted.
</p>

<p>
The food question is not the same all over Germany,
and in Berlin, Dresden, Hamburg and Leipsic
they have less than in other places. Bavaria,
the Rhine Country and East Prussia are far better
off, and in some of the small villages they do not
even have a bread card.
</p>

<p>
One of the hardest things to get is candy. In
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60'>60</a></span>
Berlin one can buy chocolate for sixteen marks a
pound, but in Dresden it is very cheap because it is
bought on the card. The candy is bought on the
grocery card and one gets a half pound every two
weeks. Candy lines are the only kind of lines that
one sees now in Germany.
</p>

<p>
One card I forgot to mention is the coal card that
will be issued for the coming winter. There is no
scarcity of coal, but there are no people or cars for
delivering. The people will be given three-fourths
as much coal as they formerly consumed.
</p>

<p>
In times of peace eating in a German restaurant
was notoriously cheap, and one could get a menu
of soup, meat, potatoes and dessert for 90 pfennigs,
and in Munich for 80 pfennigs. Now these same
restaurants charge 1.75 marks, that is, twice as
much; but even then food is cheaper than in America.
Before the war some of the restaurants charged
extra if you did not order anything to drink, but this
is now done away with.
</p>

<p>
Anything can be bought without a card if you
know how to do it. The government tries in every
way to stop this selling, and although the fine is
very heavy for selling <i>ohne Karte</i>, it goes on just
the same. We always managed to get things without
a card. Our janitress got coffee for us at 9.25
marks a pound, our vegetable woman gave us extra
potatoes, and we could always get eggs. On the
card an egg cost 30 pfennigs and without a card
we paid anywhere from 50 pfennigs to 1 mark. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61'>61</a></span>
hardest thing to get without a card was sugar, for
the food commission has an iron hand on the sugar,
but we got it for 2.50 marks a pound. On the card
it was 30 pfennigs a pound. It is said that butter
could be bought for nine marks a pound without
the card, but we never tried to get it.
</p>

<p>
The police sees that every one gets his share of
food. If a woman holds a servant girl's rations
from her, the girl can report it to the police and
the woman is fined. In a boarding-house when the
potatoes are passed around the landlady tells you
whether you can take two or three potatoes, or one
big potato and one small potato. The food conditions
are not always comfortable, but the food commission
has the things divided off so they will last
for years.

</h2>

<p>
Reading over the food restrictions, one does
not get a very clear idea of what we really
ate in Germany, so I have made out a menu that was
possible in the month of April, 1917. April is, of
course, one of the hardest months of the year because
it is just before the green vegetables come in
and the winter supplies are gone. In this month,
however, we could buy canned goods which were
forbidden during the winter months, and each person
was allowed two and one-half pounds of canned
goods a week.
</p>

<p>
The menu as I have written it includes only things
which are bought on a card or without a card, but
no restricted food that has been bought underhand
without a card as everybody does. It does not include
any of the expensive articles like chicken,
goose, or fresh vegetables which the better middle
class have, and it does not include the canned vegetables,
fruit and meat which all German families
have in their supply cupboard.
</p>

<p>
When we kept house, we obtained many things
from friends, and when my mother came back from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63'>63</a></span>
a trip to America, she brought with her forty pounds
of meat, bacon, ham and sausage, eighteen pounds
of butter, sugar, coffee, canned milk, chocolate, rice
and flour. Some of this she bought in Denmark,
and the rest she brought over from America. In
January, 1917, I made a trip to Belgium, and while
the Germans were allowed to take only ten pounds
of food out of Belgium we had special permits, and
I brought back a lot of food. Most people had
crooked ways of getting things, and we were all as
crooked as we had a chance to be.
</p>

<p>
Nothing was allowed to be sent from Poland to
Germany, but a Polish girl I knew made a trip
home to Warsaw, and going over the frontier she
made "a hit" with the man that takes up the "louse
tickets." You cannot go from Warsaw to Berlin
unless you show a ticket stating that you are not
lousy. The girl's mother in Warsaw sent the "louse
soldier" the food, and he relayed it to Berlin. Once
the soldier came to Berlin on a furlough and he
called on the Polish girl. He was an awful-looking
specimen, but he was served the finest kind of a
dinner.
</p>

<p>
In April we still had 1900 grams of bread, but I
have made out the menu with 1600 grams as it is
now. Sixteen hundred grams of bread is 32 slices
of 50 grams each, but I have allowed five slices of
bread a day, for the bread at supper was always cut
thin and often weighed only 40 grams. Most families
weighed the bread for each person and then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64'>64</a></span>
every one got his share. People who ate in restaurants
always watched their bread rations, for the
waiters were liable to bring short weights. If you
were in doubt whether you were getting enough
in a restaurant, you could demand to have the bread
weighed before you. This sometimes stirred up a
lot of trouble, and rows often occurred.
</p>

<p>
We had five pounds of potatoes a week. This
makes 2500 grams, and in the menu I have allowed
300 grams of potatoes seven times a week. As this
makes only 2100 grams, this leaves 400 grams for
the peelings. The omelet for Monday's menu could
be made out of real eggs, but the pancakes for Sunday
would have to be made out of egg substitute.
</p>

<p>
As we had 750 grams of meat a week, I have
allowed 130 grams four times a week which makes
520 grams, and this leaves 230 grams for sausage.
<i>Graupen</i> that I have mentioned is a large coarse
barley, and when I say turnips I mean what they
call <i>Kohlrüben</i>&mdash;we sometimes call it rutabaga. We
ate this vegetable constantly during the spring of
1917. Most people hated it, but it was fine for
filling up space. Dogs were fed almost entirely
on it. When I was in Dresden I went to the Zoo,
and there they had packages of carrots and <i>Kohlrüben</i>
for sale for feeding the monkeys. The monkeys
were hungry and they gobbled up the carrots,
but they absolutely refused to eat the <i>Kohlrüben</i>,
and when they were handed a piece they threw it
down in disgust.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65'>65</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This menu was typical of the German pension or
boarding-house, where the landlady stayed well
within the limit of the cards because the things on the
cards were cheap. For breakfast we always had the
same things&mdash;coffee substitute, two pieces of bread,
four times a week two pieces of sugar, and three
times saccharine, four times a week butter and three
times marmalade. Even in peace times Germans
eat only coffee and rolls for breakfast. At 11
o'clock they have a second breakfast, and this consisted
sometimes of oatmeal with salt and once in
a while a piece of bread with jam, then they could
not have so much for supper. In the afternoon at
4 o'clock they always have coffee substitute and
cake, generally made without eggs or butter and
sometimes without flour, using oatmeal or white
cornmeal for flour.

<h2>
HOW BERLIN IS AMUSING ITSELF IN
WAR TIME.
</h2>

<p>
When war was first declared all the theaters
and amusement places in Berlin were closed,
and it was not until after Christmas of that year
that they were opened again. Now everything is
open except the dance halls, for dancing is prohibited
during the war. The famous resort "<span lang="fr_FR">Palais
de Danse</span>" is closed up and its outside is all covered
with posters asking for money for the Red Cross.
</p>

<p>
The theaters in Berlin are very well attended.
As many times as I went to the opera, which was
quite often, every seat in the house was taken. The
greater part of every audience are soldiers who
are glad to spend some portion of their furloughs
forgetting the horrors of war and life in the
trenches. The operas are as brilliant as before the
war, but many of the young stage favorites are
missing, for even the matinee idol must take his
turn at the front. Several of the popular actors
have been killed.
</p>

<p>
One can always hear the French and Italian
operas, and at concerts the music of the great Russian
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70'>70</a></span>
composers. They do not prohibit the music
of enemy composers, and one can hear Verdi, Mascagni
and Gounod. However, "Madame Butterfly"
and "Bohème" were never given to my knowledge.
I do not know whether it was because they had no
singers for these operas which are great favorites,
or whether it was because of the nationality of the
composer.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
Just before I left Berlin I saw a wonderful production
of "Aïda," and the principal singers were
Poles from the Royal Opera House in Warsaw. The
singers were received with the wildest enthusiasm.
All the cast except the Poles sang in German, and
the Poles sang in Polish. The duets sounded very
funny. Two of the Polish singers were invited to
come and sing permanently in Berlin. They both
declined. The man, who has one of the most magnificent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71'>71</a></span>
voices I ever heard, because he loves Warsaw
too much to leave it, and the woman because
she did not want to be tied up in Berlin with a five-years'
contract, as she wants to come to America
as soon as the war is over. There is more or less
a movement in Germany to taboo the German singers
who are in America, and they also want to prevent
all their new young singers from coming to us.
It will be a very hard task, for America is the aim
of every German singer, and no feeling of patriotism
will keep them at home.
</p>

<p>
Since the war many new stars have arisen, and
many new operas have been played. From Bulgaria
comes a young singer by the name of Anna Todoroff,
and she has taken Berlin by storm. Several
boy wonders have sprung up, the greatest being a
little boy from Chili, Claude Arrau.
</p>

<p>
The greatest triumph of last season was Eugen
d'Albert's new opera <i><span lang="de_DE">Die toten Augen</span></i>, or "The
Dead Eyes," and it was played several times a
week. The music of the opera is lovely, entrancing,
but what a strange theme&mdash;a blind woman who is
married to a man she has never seen, prays unceasingly
for her sight so that she can see her husband.
At last her prayer is answered, and when
her eyes are opened she beholds a beautiful man
by her side whom she believes to be her husband.
She makes love to him, and he loves her in return.
The husband who was absent when his wife's sight
was restored returns, and he finds his wife's lover.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72'>72</a></span>
He challenges the man to a duel and kills him. The
woman is distracted by grief. She no longer wishes
to see, so she goes out and sits in the sun with her
eyes wide open. She sits there until her very life
is burned out. That is the end. D'Albert is a Belgian
and either his fourth or fifth wife was Madame
Carreño, the pianist, who died lately. His present
wife is an English woman.

<p>
An American named Langswroth has written a
very successful opera called "California." Perhaps
it will be played in America. An old opera that was
played frequently last winter in Berlin was Meyerbeer's
opera "<i><span lang="de_DE">Die Afrikanerin</span></i>." In spite of its age
it was very popular.
</p>

<p>
The concerts are always well attended in Berlin;
and Strauss, Nikisch and von Weingartner are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73'>73</a></span>
very popular. Each conductor has his following.
Last winter Lillie Lehmann gave a concert. She is
sixty years old, and her voice is still very beautiful.
She does not sing very often in public and spends
most of her time writing songs and teaching a few
chosen pupils.
</p>

<p>
One misses the great foreign stars who always
came to Berlin each season, but still they have the
great artists Joseph Schwartz, Conrad Ansorge,
Clara Dux, Slezak, Emil Sauer, Karl Flesch, Arthur
Schnabel and scores of others.
</p>

<p>
The character of the plays has more or less
changed since the war, and while comic operas are
still being given, the most popular shows are of a
more serious character. The greatest favorites are
Strindberg, Ibsen, Brieux, Björnsen, Shaw, Wedekind
and Shakespeare. A German loves Shakespeare
much more than an American or an Englishman
does, and last winter, all winter long, Max
Reinhardt gave Shakespeare at the <span lang="de_DE">Deutsches</span> Theater.
In spite of Shakespeare's English origin, the
plays were very well attended, and yet I do not
think the audience was like the German girl that
Percival Pollard told about. He made her say,
"What a pity that Shakespeare is not translated
into English. I should think that they would like
him in London."
</p>

<p>
The play that caused the greatest sensation in
Germany last season was a tragedy called "<i><span lang="de_DE">Liebe</span></i>,"
or "Love." It was a grewsome tale of two married
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74'>74</a></span>
people. It was full of the sordidness, the horrible
actualities of life. I lived at the same boarding-house
with the actress that took the part of the wife
in the play, <i>Frau Anna</i>, the main role. She was
quite a frivolous young German girl, but she splendidly
managed the part of a woman that had been
married nine years.

<p>
Moving picture shows are not as popular in Germany
as in America because of the high prices. In
Germany it costs as much to go to a "Kino"&mdash;that
is what they call a "movie"&mdash;as it does to sit in
the gallery at the opera. For shows no better than
our five-cent shows we had to pay two marks, and
one can sit in the gallery at the Charlottenburg
Opera House for ninety pfennigs.
</p>

<p>
They have their "movie stars," and one of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75'>75</a></span>
greatest favorites is an American girl named Fern
Andra. When I left Berlin her films were still
drawing great crowds, America's entrance into the
war having made no difference. They do not have
Charlie Chaplin in Germany. They know him in
Norway, but so far Germany has escaped. One
German editor wrote, "<i><span lang="de_DE">Gott sei Dank</span></i>, the war has
prevented us from going Chaplin mad."
</p>

<p>
As a whole the German "movies" are not nearly
so good as ours, they cannot compare with our
wonderful productions. The only part that is better
than ours is the music, and they always have fine
orchestras of from ten to thirty men. Here in
America we just drop into a "movie," but in Germany
it makes a special evening's entertainment.
Most of the "kinos" have restaurants attached, and
in all "kinos" you must check your wraps. I often
stayed away from shows just because I hated the
idea of going to the <i><span lang="de_DE">Garderobe</span></i> and checking my
wraps.

<i>Booty Exhibition in Berlin. Captured Air-Ships.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
I saw a great number of fine art exhibitions in
Germany. Germans consider an art exhibition as
one of the necessities of life. Cubist art has rather
gone out of date, and war art has taken its place.
Such stirring pictures as these war artists have produced!
Most of the best German artists have been
to the front sketching, and the war productions
of such artists as Fritz Erler and Walther Georgi
are some of the most wonderful paintings I have
ever seen. Weisgerber was another artist who has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76'>76</a></span>
made blood-stirring war pictures. He was a German
officer and was killed a year ago in France.
He was very young, and his work was full of great
promise. His work was much seen in <i><span lang="de_DE">Die Jugend</span></i>.
</p>

<p>
I saw the great Berlin exhibition of art last fall.
It was not nearly so interesting as the great international
exhibitions that were held in Germany before
the war. It was monotonous, and yet I have
never seen an exhibit where so many pictures were
sold. I saw hundreds and hundreds of pictures
marked <i><span lang="de_DE">Verkauft</span></i>.
</p>

<p>
It is surprising the number of art works of all
kinds that are being bought in Germany. I often
used to go to Lep's Auction Rooms where all kinds
of art works were sold, at auction. The place was
always crowded with bidders, and the bidding was
fast and high. I went one day to a stein sale and
saw 119 steins sold for nearly 4000 marks. I am
no judge of porcelain, but it seemed like spending a
lot of money. Another day I went with a man I
knew, a German. For 100 marks he bought three
odd tea-pot lids. He thought he had a great bargain,
but I could not see it.

<p>
Germany has always been the land of <i><span lang="de_DE">Ausstellungen</span></i>,
or "exhibitions," and the war has only
served to increase the number. In every city I
was in during the two years I saw dozens of <i><span lang="de_DE">Kriegs-Ausstellungen</span></i>
advertised. Every city has had exhibitions
of artificial arms and legs with demonstrators
showing how they work. Then they have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78'>78</a></span>
displays of uniforms, guns, aeroplanes, ships and
photographs. In Berlin they had an exhibition of
the forts around Verdun. It was wonderfully made&mdash;everything
in proportion, with tiny soldiers, wagons,
wire entanglements etc. The greatest show
they had when I was there was the "Booty Exhibition"
in which all kinds of captured war material
were displayed.
</p>

<p>
The Germans are very fond of walking, and the
war has not decreased the pleasure which they find
in this pursuit. Before the war the walkers did not
carry their lunch with them, but now they must if
they want to get anything to eat; and every afternoon
you can see crowds of people starting out,
each with a little package of lunch. The Berliners
like to go to the <span lang="de_DE">Grunewald</span> where they stop at a
little inn and order a cup of <i><span lang="de_DE">Kaffee-Ersatz</span></i>, eat their
sandwiches, and feel they are having a very nice
time.
</p>

<p>
Sitting in a café with a cup of cold coffee before
them, always has been and always will be the favorite
amusement of the German people. Here they
can read the magazines and papers and look around.
Most Germans do not entertain their friends at
home but meet them at a café, and each person pays
for what he orders.
</p>

<p>
All through the war they have boat and track
races, and these sports are very popular. Before
the war they had aeroplane exhibitions, but these
are not held any more. All the hospitals have concerts
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80'>80</a></span>
and moving picture shows for the wounded
soldiers.
</p>

<p>
The main amusement of the people now is talking
about things to eat. A man I know in Dresden
meets eight of his cronies at a <i>Stammtisch</i> every
Saturday night. Before the war they discussed politics,
art, music, literature and science, but he says
now they talk only about eating. In March and
April when we had that awful run of a vegetable
called <i>Kohlrüben</i>, the man I know said his <i>Stammtisch</i>
was going to get out a cook-book for <i>Kohlrüben</i>,
for they knew twenty-five different ways to
cook them!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81'>81</a></span>

<h2>
THE CLOTHES TICKET.
</h2>

<p>
It has been said that the sign <i>Verboten</i> was the
most seen sign in Germany, but now that sign
has a rival in <i>Ohne Bezugsschein</i>, which means
"without a clothes ticket." All the store windows
are decorated with these cards and merchants are
pushing forward these articles because they are
more expensive than the articles which require a
card, and most people would rather pay a few marks
more than go to the trouble of getting a card.
</p>

<p>
Along in May, 1916, there were rumors of a
ticket for clothes, but the people only laughed, "How
could there be a ticket for clothes?" they asked and
"What will we do if our clothes wear out and we
can't get a ticket for any more?"
</p>

<p>
On the 10th of June the ordinance was published,
and it went into effect on the 1st of August. Now
the ticket is in full swing, and one must have a
ticket to get all the articles of wearing apparel and
household things that are not marked <i>Ohne Bezugsschein</i>.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Bezugsschein</i> was not originated to make
things uncomfortable for people in general, but to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82'>82</a></span>
protect the people who are poor and to keep the
rich people from buying up the cheap useful articles
that poorer people must have for winter. At first
it was only cheap useful articles that were on the
card, and articles of clothing that were over a set
price could be bought without a card, but now many
expensive things are on a card as well, and no matter
what the price is, a man or a woman can have
only two woolen suits a year.
</p>

<p>
The following list is from the ordinance of June
10, and it tells what things can be bought without
a card. The prices quoted are the lowest prices of
articles without a ticket. The first list is of articles
which require no ticket at any price.

<p>
For every article of wearing apparel or cloth
that is not in this list and is cheaper than the set
price, one must procure a <i>Schein</i> in order to buy
the article. This means that all the cheaper waists,
dresses, aprons, pants, stockings, underwear and
skirts require a ticket, also all the cheaper cloth by
the meter. One cannot buy a yard of flannel, a wash
rag or a dusting rag without a ticket. Nearly
everything for children requires a ticket.
</p>

<p>
It is very troublesome to get a ticket, but if you
know what you want before you go to the store, you
can procure your ticket first, and this saves time.
The <i><span lang="de_DE">Bezugsscheinstellen</span></i> are scattered all over the
city. Each district has a place, and you must get
your ticket from the district in which you live. They
have on file all the <i><span lang="de_DE">Scheine</span></i> you have procured, so
you can't get more than your allowance, and if you
have moved from one place to another you must
wait until they investigate what you have had in
the other district before they will give you a <i>Schein</i>.
You must show your passport or your police registration.
</p>

<p>
The clothes ticket is a large piece of paper with
a place for your name, address and occupation. The
clerks write on the paper the article you wish and
how many of each article. For every kind of an
article a separate <i>Schein</i> is needed. On the back of
the ticket it tells that it is not transferable and that
the misuse of it makes you liable to six months imprisonment
or a fine of 15,000 marks. It also says
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85'>85</a></span>
that it is good only in the German Empire. This
is not supposed to be a joke.
</p>

<p>
If anything happens to a person's clothes, like
loss by fire, new clothes can be procured if the person
can prove that the fire was an accident. An
American I knew had all his clothes stolen except
the suit he was wearing. He went to the police and
explained his case, and after a few weeks he got a
permit to get some more clothes.
</p>

<p>
When a man gets a new suit he has to turn in his
old suit. These old suits are repaired and are put
away for the soldiers when they come home from
the war. Germany forgets no details.
</p>

<p>
The limit of things that a person can buy is
rather indefinite, for some people require more
clothes than others. Some men get twelve shirts
a year, and others get only six. Two woolen suits
are allowed and six pairs of stockings.
</p>

<p>
Since April, 1917, a ticket has been required for
shoes, and each person is allowed two pairs of shoes
a year. This is really the hardest restriction of the
whole war, for the leather is so poor that hardly the
best would last six months. Shoes for men are not
as bad as the shoes for women, and the soldiers have
very good shoes, but when I left Berlin the only
kind of shoes that a woman could buy was fancy
patent leather with cloth tops, the soles of which
were like paper. What the German women are
going to do for shoes this winter I do not know.
I could not get any shoes at all. In the summer of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86'>86</a></span>
1916 I had a pair made for sixty marks, but the
next summer they wouldn't make any to order, and
I wear so small a size that I could not get any shoes
to fit me in Berlin.
</p>

<p>
When I left for Denmark I was very shabby
looking. I had a nice silk suit and a pretty hat,
but that was the extent of my wardrobe. The girls
in the boarding-house where I lived bought nearly
everything I had. They were just wild to buy my
things, and I sold what they could wear because I
knew I could get more and they could not. It was
a pity that I am so small, because they could hardly
get into what they bought. The daughter of the
boarding-house keeper with whom I lived was going
to have her winter suit made out of a portière that
she had dyed a nice brown color. She had used
up all her tickets and couldn't buy any woolen material.
As I was going away I let the girls get
tickets in my name. This was very nice of me, for
I had to go and get the tickets myself, and I had to
wait in line to get them.
</p>

<p>
The ticket is very hard on girls about to be married,
as a German girl must furnish the house and
have at least two dozen sets of sheets and pillow
cases and about one hundred towels. As one person
can get only two sheets a year on the ticket,
it would at that rate take a girl twelve years before
she could be properly married. So the scheming
of getting things without a ticket was as great as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87'>87</a></span>
the scheming of getting food without a card, and
the government cannot prevent it.
</p>

<p>
A week before I left Berlin, a printed card was
hung up in my room at the boarding-house. It said,
"After August 1 people coming to this boarding-house
for an extended stay must bring their own
bedding with them. The washing will be done every
four weeks." It was signed "The Boarding-House
Union." I was glad that the washing was to be
done every four weeks, because I was seven weeks
at that boarding-house, and I never once had clean
sheets. After three weeks the sheets got a kind of gray
color, and then they never seemed to get any dirtier.
Special provisions are made at hotels where each
guest must be furnished with a clean sheet.
</p>

<p>
The clothes <i>Schein</i> is especially designed to
limit the sale of woolen goods, and many German
women who had never worn silk before in their
lives are wearing it now, because wool is so expensive.
The ticket is very hard on the dry-goods
merchants, the tailors and the men's furnishers,
and they complain that their business is frightful,
but Germany doesn't care for the individuals, she
is looking out for the country as a whole.

<h2>
MY TYPEWRITER.
</h2>

<p>
It is not only clothes that are getting scarce in
Germany, but every kind of manufactured articles
as well. Many articles of furniture cannot be
bought at all now, even second-hand, and the prices
for things still in stock are enormous. A German
girl I know was going to be married, and she
wanted twin brass beds. She tried all over Dresden
but could not get two single brass beds alike.
She could not even order them, because she was
told by the merchants that they were not being
made any more. A perfectly plain brass bed, single
size, was 390 marks.
</p>

<p>
All the old stock of manufactured articles, furniture,
cooking utensils, goods by the yard, tablecloths,
towels and sheets are being bought up by the people,
because they say that the new stock which will be
manufactured after the war will be of an inferior
quality, and it will be years before they can get the
good grade of goods again.
</p>

<p>
Just to illustrate the scarcity of manufactured
articles I will tell the story about my typewriter.
When I first went to Germany I rented a Smith
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89'>89</a></span>
Premier for three months for thirty marks. Every
one said that this was a great bargain. When the
three months were over I sent the typewriter firm a
check in payment for three months more. I didn't
hear anything from them for about a month, when
one day a young man called on me and said that he
had come for the typewriter, that his firm was not
renting typewriters any more, but that I could buy
it if I wished, for 390 marks. Reckoning a mark
as a quarter as the Germans do, that meant nearly
one hundred dollars for a very old rattle-trap typewriter
that any one could buy in America for fifteen
dollars.
</p>

<p>
I told the young man that I would not be threatened
into buying his typewriter, and that if he took
it away he would have to give me back my entire
thirty marks even though I had had it a month. We
argued for about an hour, and then he went away.
The next day I got a letter saying that I could keep
the typewriter the remaining two months, but that
at the end of that time I must either give it up or
buy it. At the end of the two months I sent another
check for thirty marks, but the next day a girl messenger
dressed as a boy appeared, handed me back
my check, took my typewriter under her arm and
disappeared. I hoped carrying it would make her
good and tired.
</p>

<p>
I did not want to lay out 400 or 500 marks for a
typewriter, and I had an awful time. It was absolutely
impossible to rent a typewriter anywhere in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90'>90</a></span>
Berlin, and I went everywhere. I put an advertisement
in the paper and I got only six answers and
upon going to all of these six places, I found that
at each place the typewriter was a "Mignon," a
little toy machine where you had to turn a wheel
whenever you struck a letter.
</p>

<p>
After spending four days hunting, I finally bought
a "Pittsburg Visible." I paid sixty-five marks for
it, and it wasn't like any typewriter I have seen
before&mdash;or since. It was very curious to look at&mdash;a
long, thin affair with very weak prongs that were
always getting twisted around each other. It must
have been twenty-five or thirty years old. I was
always in terror for fear something would happen
to it, and whenever we had a guest I yelled, "Be
careful and don't bump the typewriter," or "Don't
lay your hat on the typewriter." When I first used
it, it had the bad habit of getting stuck in the middle
of a line, but after I had had it a year, it worked
pretty well and I became very much attached to my
little "Pittsburg Visible."
</p>

<p>
During the year I had my typewriter, typewriters
became scarcer and dearer than ever, indeed it was
impossible to buy any kind of a second-hand visible
typewriter, and the new ones were about 600 marks.
New correspondents coming over had an awful time
and most of them had to borrow typewriters from
friends. As most of the typewriters were of American
make, it was hard to get a typewriter repaired,
as the parts came from America. Ribbons and carbon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91'>91</a></span>
paper were very expensive, and although typewriter
paper doubled its price, it was cheaper than
the paper here in America.
</p>

<p>
At the time I sold my little Pittsburg Visible in
June 1917, I was living in a German boarding-house
in Berlin. I believe in advertising, so I put an "ad"
in the "<span lang="de_DE">Lokal-Anzeiger</span>" which read: "For sale&mdash;cheap,
visible typewriter, Pension Kostermann, Savigny-Platz
5." I thought that it was a very nice
"ad" and it cost me one mark ninety pfennigs.
</p>

<p>
I will never forget the day my "ad" came out.
Before I was up at seven A. M. the maid knocked
at my door and said that I was wanted at the telephone.
It was some one about the typewriter. That
was the beginning. The phone rang all day long,
and all the next day. People came in droves, and
they would not go away even after the typewriter
was sold. They wanted to know what kind it was,
and they left cursing themselves that they had not
come earlier.
</p>

<p>
Before I advertised in the paper I had decided
to hold out for my price, one hundred marks. At
10.30 A. M. I was offered ninety marks, but I said
one hundred was my price. At 11.30 there was a
lull in the callers, but the telephone rang like wild.
A little Jew came in and offered me fifty-three
marks for my typewriter. I was standing there
looking very much insulted at the idea of any one
daring to offer me fifty-three marks for my good
machine, when suddenly the landlady appeared at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92'>92</a></span>
the door of my room. "Fräulein McAuley," she said
severely, glaring at the Jew, "I want this to cease.
The maids have done nothing this morning but answer
the phone and go to the door about your typewriter.
Do you understand?"
</p>

<p>
I felt squelched and begged her pardon, and when
she left banging the door after her, I looked helplessly
at the Jew. "Sixty-five marks," he said sympathetically.
"Make it sixty-six," I said, "and you
can have it." "Done," he answered, and I sold my
typewriter at the profit of one mark after having
it a year.
</p>

<p>
I explained to the landlady that I had not put the
telephone number in the paper, and she was pacified.
Her daughter admired the American way in which
I had made the sale, and the following day she put
an "ad" in the same paper for a pair of field glasses
she had. "All the soldiers will want them," she
said. They prepared for a rush such as I had had
for the typewriter, and not a soul answered the
advertisement. Both mother and daughter blamed
me for it. I think they thought that I had done
something more than merely advertise in the paper.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93'>93</a></span>

<h2>
MOVING IN BERLIN.
</h2>

<p>
When you move from one place to another in
Berlin it takes just about three days to get
all the food cards in order again. Here is what
you would have to do if you move from one suburb
of Berlin to another, say from Charlottenburg to
Wilmersdorf. This is for all foreigners&mdash;even
neutrals.
</p>

<p>
First you go to the <i><span lang="de_DE">Portier</span></i> or janitor of the building
where you live in Charlottenburg, and he gives
you three green slips which you fill out. These slips
tell your name, age, occupation, religion, nationality,
where you were born and where you last lived.
After they are filled out the <i><span lang="de_DE">Portier</span></i> signs them.
The <i><span lang="de_DE">Portier</span></i> keeps one slip, sends one to the magistrate
of Charlottenburg and gives you the third.
With this green slip you go to the Charlottenburg
police. In the first room a policeman looks up your
record which you are surprised to find filed in a little
box, and if your record is all right he sends you into
the next room where the chief presides. The chief
of each police station has charge of all the foreigners,
and at the little branch police station on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94'>94</a></span>
Mommsenstrasse where I reported in June the chief
told me he had over five hundred foreigners in his
district.
</p>

<p>
You present your green slip, which the man outside
has stamped, and your passport to the chief,
and after more filing and stamping both on the slip
and on your pass, you are ready to move. As soon
as you get to Wilmersdorf the new <i><span lang="de_DE">Portier</span></i> gives
you three white slips to fill out. They are very
similar to the green ones and ask the same questions.
The <i><span lang="de_DE">Portier</span></i> signs these, and he keeps one, sends
one to the magistrate of Wilmersdorf, and with the
third white slip, your green slip and your pass, you
go to the police in Wilmersdorf. Here they file
and stamp and then give you back your pass and
the white slip which has been stamped for the bread
commission.
</p>

<p>
It is not necessary to go to the bread commission
in Charlottenburg, but you must take all your food
cards and your white slip with you to the bread
commission in Wilmersdorf. Here they look over
all your cards very carefully to make sure you are
not trying to cheat them and then they give you an
entirely new lot of cards cutting them off up to date
so you can't get more than your share of food. So
far moving has been easy, but the worst part of the
business is to come, and that is getting registered to
buy meat, eggs, butter, sugar and potatoes at certain
stores. Lately this registering has been somewhat
simplified, and you can get registered at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95'>95</a></span>
bread commission for all the articles except meat,
but when the registering was first introduced each
person had to go to the <i><span lang="de_DE">Rathaus</span></i> or city hall himself
and get registered for each article. This meant
that one had to stand at least an hour&mdash;for there
were always such crowds&mdash;at five different rooms
waiting to have your sugar, meat, butter, potato
and egg cards stamped so that you would be allowed
to buy these articles, and after you were registered
you could buy them only in a certain store, but if
you weren't registered you couldn't buy these articles
at all. This registering scheme was a very
good one, for since it has been introduced there has
been no standing for any of these articles, and when
the people go for their butter or eggs they find it
waiting for them, and the food controllers give each
shopkeeper just as much of each of these articles
as he can show he has customers registered to buy
that article in his store. This has also done away
with a lot of selling <i><span lang="de_DE">Ohne Karte</span></i>, or without a card,
for the shopkeeper does not dare to sell without
cards, for then he would not have enough for his
registered customers and then the police would get
after him.
</p>

<p>
Just to show you what a trouble this registering
is I will tell you of the time I had getting registered
to buy an egg. I got the egg card easily enough.
I had lived at a boarding-house before and I did not
even know that you had to be registered for eggs.
I took my egg card and went to Herr Blumfeld,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96'>96</a></span>
an egg-dealer near by, and told him I wanted to buy
the egg due on my card. That week we got only
one egg apiece. Herr Blumfeld said that he would
gladly sell me the egg, but first I would have to go
to the magistrate of Charlottenburg and get registered
to buy from him, but that after I got registered
I could always buy eggs from him.
</p>

<p>
That didn't sound so hard, so I took the egg card
and went to the court-house, which was about six
stations on the underground. The court-house was
black with people madly rushing to and fro with
cards in their hands, red cards, green cards, yellow
cards and blue cards. There were soldiers, prosperous
looking business men, maids, children, well-dressed
women, and women with shawls on their
heads. Guides were stationed everywhere, but the
people did not seem to be able to find the room they
wanted.
</p>

<p>
I asked a guide where the egg room was, and he
pointed it out to me, "<i><span lang="de_DE">Eierzimmer</span> 91</i>." I had to
go up five flights of stairs, for all the registering
rooms were on the top floors. About seventy-five
people were ahead of me waiting to be registered
to buy eggs. It was about an hour before my turn
came, and then I presented my card and said, "I
would like to buy eggs from Herr Blumfeld on
Pestalozzistrasse."
</p>

<p>
"Where is your <i><span lang="de_DE">Ausweiskarte</span></i>?" the lady at the
desk asked. I told her I had none and had never
heard of one.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97'>97</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I can't register you for eggs without an <i><span lang="de_DE">Ausweiskarte</span></i>.
So you will have to go home to your <i><span lang="de_DE">Portier</span></i>
and get one."
</p>

<p>
I took the underground and hurried home. The
<i><span lang="de_DE">Portier</span></i> said that he had no <i><span lang="de_DE">Ausweis</span></i>, or permit
cards, and that I would have to go to the bread
commission and get it. After waiting at the bread
commission in line for an hour, I succeeded in getting
an <i><span lang="de_DE">Ausweis</span></i> card, and then I rushed back to
the magistrate. This time I had to wait only half
an hour, and at last I came to the desk and was
registered to buy an egg from Mr. Blumfeld of
Pestalozzistrasse.
</p>

<p>
I had spent the whole day trying to get that egg,
and I was happy in the thought that my efforts
were not in vain. As I rode back on the underground
I was trying to decide, "Would I eat my
egg for breakfast or for dinner? Would I have
it boiled or fried?" and then the awful thought
came to me, "What if the egg was bad?" That
would be too cruel!
</p>

<p>
It was just seventeen and a half minutes to eight
when I got back to the egg shop of Herr Blumfeld.
He was sweeping. I waved my card triumphantly,
"I have it," I cried. He leaned his broom against
the counter and pointed to a sign hanging over the
stove, "<i><span lang="de_DE">Eier ausverkauft</span></i>" (Eggs sold out). I looked
at it, then staggered, and then fainted dead away
in the greasy arms of the astonished Herr Blumfeld,
<i><span lang="de_DE">Eier-Grosshändler</span></i>.

<h2>
WHAT THE GERMANS READ IN WAR
TIME.
</h2>

<p>
"Gobble! Ah a gobble!" That is what it
sounds like when you hear the newspaper
sellers crying out their wares on Potsdamer Platz
in the evening. But this is really not what they are
saying. They are saying, <i><span lang="de_DE">Abendausgabe</span></i> or "Evening
Edition."
</p>

<p>
It is a pretty sight, the Potsdamer Platz&mdash;cabs
rattling along, jingling street-car bells, the square
black with civilians and gray with soldiers, wagons
drawn up to the sidewalks loaded down with bright-colored
fruit and vegetables, women selling flowers&mdash;violets,
roses, lilies-of-the-valley&mdash;<i><span lang="de_DE">Zehn Pfennige
ein Sträusschen</span></i>, and above all the other sounds the
cries of "Gobble! Gobble Ah-a-gobble!"
</p>

<p>
Compared with our big American newspapers
a German paper is a very little affair. Its pages
are about half as big as the pages of our papers,
and in the morning they usually have only eight
pages, and in the evening six. There are no glaring
headlines to a German paper, and no red ink is used.
Even when Kitchener was drowned or America
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99'>99</a></span>
declared war, it appeared in the papers as a headline
with letters no more than three-quarters of an
inch high.
</p>

<p>
There is absolutely nothing sensational about a
German newspaper, even in war time. They all
look alike, and one has to look at the date of the
paper to make sure that it is not the paper of the
day before. They have no cartoons, and they rarely
have any pictures. The Sunday supplement has
few "funnies" and never any colored pictures. There
are no spicy scandals, no sensational divorce trials
and no tales of thrilling murders with the picture
of the house where the dark deed was committed
marked with an X. Then there is no woman's
page and no society column. You ask, well, what
have they in their papers?

<i>A Reading-Room for Soldiers on the West Front.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
On the first page is the war news, very brief. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100'>100</a></span>
gives the General Staff's report from all the war
fronts, and this report is signed by the general on
each of these fronts. The second page is devoted
to news of a more local character. They often print
interviews on this page. They make more of a feature
of interviews in Germany than we do in America.
On the other pages they have sports, the drama,
music, stories, and always one article of literary
character. One of the big features on the front
page is the printing of the under-sea boat booty.
Whatever is printed in the German newspapers is
the truth as far as it goes, but not everything that
is known is printed. What the people really get
is the truth without details. The people would like
to read these details, but they do not get them.
One of the most surprising things that was printed
was Zimmermann's letter to Mexico. It came out
in all the papers, for Zimmermann thought that the
best thing to do was to publish it. It was not very
popular with the German people.
</p>

<p>
One of the things that was not printed in the
German papers was the great spy scandal in Norway.
I never heard one word about it until I came
to Norway. The papers are controlled by a censor.
Once last summer the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> was shut
off for three days. They printed something which
the censor did not like, but the general public never
found out what the offending article was.
</p>

<p>
There are three great publishing houses in Berlin.
First, the August Scherl Company, which publishes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101'>101</a></span>
the daily newspaper <i><span lang="de_DE">Lokal-Anzeiger</span></i>, a morning
and an evening paper which has a very large
circulation among the poorer class of people and is
used for small advertisers. Scherl also publishes
<i><span lang="de_DE">Die Woche</span></i>, a weekly well known in America; <i><span lang="de_DE">Die
Gartenlaube</span></i>, a magazine for women; <i><span lang="de_DE">Der Tag</span></i>; and
<i><span lang="de_DE">Der Montag</span></i>, a newspaper which comes out every
Monday.
</p>

<p class="caption">
<i>A Field Book-Store in France.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
A second great company is the Rudolf Mosse
Company which publishes the well-known <i><span lang="de_DE">Berliner
Tageblatt</span></i>, a morning and an evening paper. The
third and perhaps greatest company is the Ullstein
Company which publishes the <i><span lang="de_DE">Vossische Zeitung</span></i>,
a morning and evening paper; the <i><span lang="de_DE">Berliner Morgenpost</span></i>,
a paper read by the working class; <i><span lang="de_DE">B. Z. am
Mittag</span></i>, a little sheet which comes out at noon and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102'>102</a></span>
is easily the most popular paper in Berlin; the <i><span lang="de_DE">Berliner
Illustrierte Zeitung</span></i>, a splendid weekly which
sells for ten pfennigs. Everybody in Berlin reads
this weekly, for it has good war articles, fine stories
and many interesting pictures. There are many
other papers published in Berlin, such as the 8 <i><span lang="de_DE">Uhr
Abendblatt</span></i>, a sheet which comes out at seven in the
evening, and the <i><span lang="de_DE">Tägliche Rundschau</span></i>, a splendid
paper of literary character.
</p>

<p>
The morning papers cost ten pfennigs and the
evening papers cost five pfennigs. Last summer
the <i>B. Z. am Mittag</i> raised its price to ten pfennigs,
but the public refused to pay the price and in four
days it was back to 5 pfennigs again.
</p>

<p>
All the larger papers have what they call a <i><span lang="de_DE">Briefkasten</span></i>
or a letter box, which is an information and
clipping bureau combined. Here forty or fifty people
are employed all day long clipping and filing
things. Any one can go to this bureau or write to
them and is given information free of charge. They
even give medical advice free.
</p>

<p>
The large publishing houses publish books. The
Ullstein Company makes a specialty of books for
one mark each. They published the "Voyage of
the U Deutschland" by Captain Paul König, and
every one in Germany read this book.
</p>

<p>
There is one newspaper in Berlin published in
English. It is supposed to be an American paper,
but its Americanism was of a very peculiar brand.
This paper is called the <i>Continental Times</i>. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103'>103</a></span>
most prominent socialistic paper is called the <i><span lang="de_DE">Vorwärts</span></i>.
It is allowed a good deal of freedom but
once in a while it is suppressed. On the 19th of
April of this year 3000 working men and women
gathered on Unter den Linden. It was the only
approach to a strike or a riot that I saw as long as
I stayed in Germany. The <i><span lang="de_DE">Vorwärts</span></i> was against
this movement, and mostly through its influence
the people went back home. The paper has a tremendous
influence. Maximilian Harden's pamphlet
<i><span lang="de_DE">Zukunft</span></i> is universally read with much interest and
curiosity. Harden is allowed about the same privileges
in Germany as Bernard Shaw is allowed in
England.

<i>German Soldiers on the West Front Reading War Bulletins.</i>

<p>
In the main cities in the territory captured by the
Germans, in Lille, Brussels, Warsaw, Lodz and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104'>104</a></span>
Vilna, they have established very good papers
printed in German. Then they have papers issued
for the soldiers at the front, like the <i><span lang="de_DE">Champagner
Kamerad</span></i>, and the <i><span lang="de_DE">Landsturm</span></i>. These papers contain
war news, stories, jokes and poems.

<p>
German newspapers never call their enemies ugly
names, and they have remained very dignified sheets.
English newspapers are very much read in Germany.
These papers are only four days old, and as
most of the Germans of the better class read English,
they are in great demand. In any of the leading
cafés or at the newsdealers one can have the
<i>London Times</i>, the <i>Daily Mail</i>, the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>,
the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, the <i>Graphic</i>, <i>Sphere</i>
and <i>Punch</i>. French and Italian papers are also to
be had. American papers came very irregularly,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105'>105</a></span>
but even yet a few leak through, and when I left
in July I saw American papers up to April 30. If
news in an English paper does not coincide with
that in the German paper, the German reader does
not believe it&mdash;that is the only impression it makes
on him.
</p>

<p>
In Berlin they do not have great war bulletins
in front of the newspaper offices as we do at home.
The nearest approach to our bulletins is in Copenhagen,
where they hang bulletins, printed in very
large letters, in the second-story window of the
newspaper office. A German war bulletin is about
as big as an ordinary sheet of typewriting paper,
and it is hung low in the newspaper office window
where every one takes his turn reading the fine
print. Sometimes the bulletins are written by hand
with a lead pencil. Other bulletins are printed on
single sheets of paper and are distributed on the
streets free.
</p>

<p>
The number of pamphlets written about the war
is endless. Every doctor and every professor in
Germany seems to have written a book, and every
phase of the war has been touched upon. Most of
the books are gotten up in a very attractive way
with soft backs. They have very few stiff-backed
books in Germany. Since the war many books on
art, music, science, medicine and literature have
been published.
</p>

<p>
Newspapers have to keep down to a certain size
on account of the scarcity and cost of paper, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106'>106</a></span>
books are no more expensive than they were before
the war, and they have book sales the same as we
have in America. A few weeks before I left, Wertheim's
large department store had a sale of English-German
dictionaries, very large books at four marks
each. They had a window decorated with these
books, and they were soon all snapped up, for the
Germans said that they could see no reason why
they should not go on with their study of English
because the English were enemies.

<p><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107'>107</a></span>
The war has not spoiled the German's love of
reading romances, and so many novels of the
cheaper type have been written that a society has
been formed to keep the boys and girls from reading
them. They have automatic book stands in all railway
stations where you put twenty pfennigs in the
slot and get a novel. There are many cheap editions
of patriotic songs printed in small pocket volumes
convenient for soldiers in the trenches.

<h2>
PRECAUTIONS AGAINST SPIES, ETC.
</h2>

<p class="center">
<span lang="de_DE">SOLDATEN!</span><br />
<span lang="de_DE">Vorsicht bei Gesprächen!</span><br />
<span lang="de_DE">Spionengefahr!</span>
</p>

<p>
This sign is hanging in every street car, train
coupé, restaurant, store and window with a
war map in Germany, and it warns the soldiers to
be careful in their speaking, that dangerous spies
travel about.
</p>

<p>
Germany is trying to prevent things that she does
not wish known from becoming known by locking
them up even in the mouths of her soldiers, and if
she were as clever at concealing her tactics abroad
as she is at home, Zimmermann's famous letter to
Mexico would never have been found.
</p>

<p>
Not only the soldiers on the streets must keep
quiet, but the soldiers in the field as well, and each
soldier has written directions that in case he is taken
prisoner he shall give no information to the enemy.
He must not tell the number of his regiment, his
age or what district he is from, for all these things
give the enemy important information. It is especially
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109'>109</a></span>
important that the enemy shall not know what
regiment is opposing them.
</p>

<p>
All the foreigners in Germany are under police
control, but none of the enemy civilians are interned
except the English. The Americans, Russians,
French, Belgians and Italians are free except that
they must report once a day to the police, and they
cannot go from one city to another without a permit.
Most of the Americans get off with going to
the police only once a week. The Poles have to go
twice a week. All neutral foreigners must go to
the police and register when they change their address.
The Germans must do this too in order to
get a bread card. The food cards have been great
things for weeding out criminals and spies, for no
one can get a card unless he is registered at the
police, and many famous criminals who have been
evading the police for years have been caught since
the war.
</p>

<p>
There are very few slums in Germany, but in
Berlin they have a few dens where crooks hold
out, and bread cards can be bought for fifty pfennigs
to one mark. An American boy I knew in
Berlin who spoke German like a native, used to
dress in old clothes and visit these places. Sometimes
he was taken for a foreigner but nearly always
for a German. He said that the men made
signs from one table to the other when they had
anything to sell. He often bought cards for fifty
pfennigs. One crook that he got acquainted with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110'>110</a></span>
was a German who went around begging, saying
that he was a Belgian refugee. He had some kind
of a medal to show people and his begging business
netted him a nice little income.
</p>

<p>
The boy said that the slums were rather "slow,"
very little drinking and a great deal of planning
of things that they were afraid to carry out, for a
German crook hasn't much courage. One café that
the boy often visited was the "Café <i>Dalles</i>," which
means "Café Down and Out." It was situated right
near the Kaiser's Berlin palace. One night in the
summer of 1916 it was raided just a few minutes
before the boy got to the place. Through this raid
the police discovered that some one was manufacturing
bread cards by the thousands each week.
They were an almost perfect imitation of the real
cards. Of course even the clever Berlin police could
not control all the crooked work that was going on
with the food cards, but they kept things pretty well
under hand. One scheme that was worked was,
when a family changed their residence, to register
an extra one in the family. I used to wonder often
that the Germans had the nerve to do this, for they
were terribly afraid of being caught.
</p>

<p>
In Germany a foreigner uses his passport on every
occasion, and one must always carry it. You can't
send a telegram out of Germany without showing
your pass, and then if you send it in any other language
than German, you must make a German
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111'>111</a></span>
translation of the message at the bottom of the
sheet.
</p>

<p>
No foreigner, not even a neutral, is allowed to
go to the seaside unless he has a doctor's certificate,
and even then it is hard to get a permit.
No kodaks are allowed at the seaside, and one is
not allowed to sketch. Now they are very strict
about any one taking pictures in or around Berlin.
</p>

<p>
When you come into Germany, you are not allowed
to bring either a kodak or a Bible with you.
One can easily see the reason for the kodak being
prohibited, but people are always surprised when
their Bibles are taken away from them. In all wars
the Bible has been used as a place for concealing
secret messages and the garb of a priest, nun, or
minister has been a favorite disguise for spies.
</p>

<p>
A man I knew in Berlin came over by way of
Holland. He had a Bible, a prayer-book and a
Chicago telephone book with him. He was astonished
when they took the Bible and the prayer-book
away from him and allowed him to keep the telephone
book. It was winter when he came over, and
he had on a coat with turn-back cuffs. He lives in
Chicago, and he had acquired the habit of sticking
street-car transfers in his cuffs. When he was
searched the searcher found a transfer in the cuff,
and the American was marched off to an officer.
The German officer looked at the transfer long and
interestedly and then laughed, "Why, I know that
line, I have been in Chicago myself."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112'>112</a></span>
</p>

<p>
On this same boat was a preacher. The preacher
was sure that he as a member of the cloth would
have no trouble, and then he had a stack of credentials
sky-high. When he was searched more
closely than the rest he grew insolent and said
things, and as a result he was held up three days
until his friends in Germany helped him out.
</p>

<p>
My mother was nearly held up on the German
border when she left Germany. A German lady
in Dresden asked her to take some presents to her
daughter in America, and among the things were
two little bibs worked in a cross stitch design that
were to be given to the daughter's child. The officials
at Warnemünde seemed to think that the designs
meant something, and they studied over them
a long time, but finally after half an hour they gave
them back to mother but with an air of not being
sure what the cross stitch designs really were.
</p>

<p>
The greatest role for spies in this war is that of
Red Cross worker. Here they have much freedom,
and they can get very near the front. Then a sick
or wounded man will tell things that a well man
will not. Also, it is not so hard for them to transmit
messages to their fellow conspirators. In every
country Red Cross workers are closely watched.
</p>

<p>
Another kind of spy is the newspaper spy. There
was a newspaper spy in Berlin when I was there.
He posed as being very <i><span lang="de_DE">deutschfreundlich</span></i>, and his
good cigars and quantities of spending-money got
him lots of information. When newspaper men are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113'>113</a></span>
taken to the front, they have to sign a paper that
they will not leave Germany for a month after their
return. They also have to sign a paper that they
will not hold the German government responsible in
case of anything happening to them.
</p>

<p>
They tell all sorts of spy stories in Germany, and
some of them sound very far-fetched. Here is a
typical one. In East Prussia a nun was found
weeping in a railway station. She had a funeral
wreath in her hands. A sympathetic crowd gathered
around her and tried to comfort her. Finally,
a little boy in the crowd cried, "Oh, look, mother,
what big hands she has!" The crowd looked, and
sure enough they were big&mdash;they were a man's
hands. And the nun was found to be a man, a
Russian spy.
</p>

<p>
An American girl I knew was arrested as a spy.
She was summering in a little town in the Westphalia
district. She was an ardent photographer,
and she could not see anything without wanting to
snap it. The second day there, she was out walking
and discovered what she considered a neat bit&mdash;green
trees and a factory in the distance. She
snapped the picture and just then a voice behind
her asked what she was doing. She looked around
and there stood a German soldier who told her to
come with him. She went. She was taken to a
guard house where her pass was examined and the
film developed. When the films came out it was
found she had a picture of a bridge and two munition
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114'>114</a></span>
factories. They gave the girl two hours to get
out of the town. She never dreamed it was <i>verboten</i>.
</p>

<p>
All the munition factories, granaries, wharves,
supply places and flying-places in Germany are
guarded night and day, and if any one goes poking
around these places he is told to "move on." If any
one can spy on any of these locked-up places he must
be very clever.

</h2>

<p>
Every thirtieth person in Germany is a war
prisoner. Every fifth man is a Russian.
</p>

<p>
In Germany there are now nearly 2,000,000 prisoners
of war. In the summer of 1916 the Central
Powers held 2,658,283 prisoners, and of this number
1,647,225 were held in Germany. This was
before Roumania fell, and then the number was
greatly increased.
</p>

<p>
They have 150 large prison camps and five hundred
small prison camps in Germany, and there are
hundreds of places where the working prisoners
live. The largest camps are at Guben and Czersh,
where the prisoners are mostly Russians. The camps
at Zossen, Wunsdorf, Nuremberg and Ratisbon are
also very large.
</p>

<p>
The camps are divided into military divisions, and
they are run like real military camps. The common
prisoners sleep in dormitories, and they are furnished
with a straw mattress, a pillow and colored
bed covers. The men must keep their own beds
clean, and they are compelled to take a bath every
day. Many of the prisoners are employed around
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116'>116</a></span>
the camp, some of them helping in the cooking and
the baking. In a camp of 10,000 prisoners it is no
easy task to get the meals ready.
</p>

<p>
The prisoners, especially on the east front, are
compelled to be vaccinated against cholera, typhoid
and small-pox, and every prisoner must be disinfected
for lice and fleas, even his clothes. Every
Russian prisoner must have his head shaved. Prisoners
are employed as barbers.

<p>
Every prisoner is allowed to write four postcards
and two letters each month, and these letters are
censored. All prisoners except the Russians receive
many packages from their homes. In the Stuttgart
camp, where the soldiers are mostly English and
French, the twenty-four hundred prisoners receive
on an average seventeen thousand packages each
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117'>117</a></span>
month. Every package is censored. No alcoholic
drinks are allowed to be sent, and also no cartoons
that would be offensive to the Germans.
</p>

<p>
The English and French prisoners receive spending
money from their families, and most of them
are never without spending money for tobacco and
beer. It goes much harder with the Russians whose
families are too poor to send anything. That is one
reason why the Russian prisoners are anxious to
work.
</p>

<p>
Most of the Russian prisoners are employed in
carrying the ashes out of the apartment houses, and
the big burly fellows lift the great iron cans as
though they were made of paper. These men are
quite free, and they run their wagons without a
guard. They are very well behaved, attending
strictly to their own business and speaking to no
one. It is <i>verboten</i> for the German people to speak
to them, so of course they do not do it. The working
Russian prisoners wear their soldier uniform, a
brown coat, brown corduroy trousers and a brown
cap with a green band. They have a black stripe
sewed around their sleeve. This shows they are
prisoners.

<p>
Last fall many of the prisoners were employed
in cutting down trees in the <span lang="de_DE">Grunewald</span>. A guard
was always stationed near them. I was walking
one day with a German who spoke Polish, when we
came upon a group of prisoners. The German
asked the Russians in Polish how they liked Berlin.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119'>119</a></span>
"<i><span lang="de_DE">Sehr gut, aber</span></i>&mdash;" (very good, but&mdash;) one of the
fellows answered. Just then a German guard came
from the top of the hill, and he told us to move on.
In Germany, every time anything became truly
interesting I was told to move on.

<p>
A great many Russians work on the railroad
tracks, and still others are employed in factories,
gardening and working in the fields. Those that
work in the factories are not employed in the explosive
departments but are engaged in lifting heavy
bars of metal and shells. In these factories the
men are closely guarded, but the average Russian
is very docile and easy to manage.
</p>

<p>
Very few English prisoners do any work, but
many French prisoners are employed in factories
and in the fields. They still wear their bright red
trousers. In Dresden I saw a lot of these red-trousered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121'>121</a></span>
fellows running around the streets loose. One
prisoner had a little German child with him. She
was a little girl of about four years of age, and she
clung to his hand and seemed very fond of him.

<p>
At Circus Busch last winter a great spectacular
play was produced and as five hundred supers were
needed for the show, men were taken from the
prison camps to take part. There were English,
French, Arabs and Turcos, all dressed in their own
uniforms, but some of the prisoners had to take the
part of German soldiers. They were dressed in the
regular German uniform and they looked rather
sheepish. Of course in the play the Germans won
all of the battles, but there was a waiting list of
prisoners who wanted jobs in the show. They were
paid one mark a night. The theater management
was responsible for the safety of the prisoners, and
the theater was well guarded.
</p>

<p>
Two of the most interesting camps in Germany
are the two near Berlin, the one at Zossen and that
for the English at Ruhleben. The camp at Zossen
is about an hour's ride from Berlin and can be seen
from the train window on the way to Dresden. It
is built in the open country and is a town of small
houses. They have all kinds of prisoners here.
</p>

<p>
The "Gentlemen's Camp" at Ruhleben is where
the English civil prisoners are interned, and some
very rich and influential men are here. Ruhleben
is built on a race track, and though at first it had
only a few buildings, it is now a small town. It has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123'>123</a></span>
its main streets, its shops, its restaurants, its reading
rooms, its select circle and its four hundred.
It had a theater, the director of which was the
director of one of the Berlin theaters before the war.

</p>

<p>
They have a newspaper printed in Ruhleben. The
German authorities do not allow these papers to
be sent out of the camp, but I was lucky enough
to have seen one of them. An English girl I knew
in Berlin got one of them from the German wife of
a Ruhleben prisoner. I had to swear that while I
was in Germany I would never tell I had seen it.
It was a very neat little sheet with stories, poems
and advertisements&mdash;no news. The advertisements
were for the different shops and stores in Ruhleben.
Some of the men interned there carry on trades,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124'>124</a></span>
and I saw advertisements for printing, clothes-pressing
and tailoring.
</p>

<p>
At Ruhleben they have what they call their "university,"
and here they have classes in languages,
art and science, and for the colored prisoners they
have the common school branches. All these benefits
were not gotten up by the Germans, but by the
prisoners themselves. The men are allowed to spend
only a certain amount of money each month, which
keeps down the gambling, but they are allowed to
buy what furniture they wish.

<p>
A great cry has been raised against the small
amount of food given the prisoners at Ruhleben.
I heard from all sides that this was true, and that in
winter they have very little coal. But Germany
can't give her prisoners much&mdash;she can't give even
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125'>125</a></span>
her own people much. What they have to give the
Russian prisoners is a mystery&mdash;perhaps just
enough to exist on.

<p>
When I was in Germany, an English preacher
was invited to come over from England and inspect
the Ruhleben camp. He was met at the German
frontier by a German officer and escorted direct to
Ruhleben. He spent one week in the camp, living
the same life the English prisoners live. He was
allowed to bring messages to the men and to take
messages from the men back to England&mdash;censored
of course. There were rumors around Berlin about
him, but there was nothing in the German papers.
I read his report in the <i>London Times</i> after he got
back to England. He said that the men were comfortable
and that they had an intellectual life, but
he added that the men surely needed the food packages
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126'>126</a></span>
sent from England and that they received the
packages sent.
</p>

<p>
One day the first summer I was in Berlin, I was
in Wertheim's department store. I saw a great
many people gathered around the sporting-goods
counter. When I asked what was the matter I was
told that the two men in civilian clothes were Englishmen
from Ruhleben, and that they had come to
Berlin to buy a tennis racket. They were accompanied
by a German sergeant. The Englishmen
seemed to be enjoying themselves and they took a
long time to select the rackets.

<p>
This spring they left a number of men out of
Ruhleben. These men wanted to work. One day
I was standing in my boarding-house hall talking
to the landlady, when a fine-looking young man
came up and asked for a room. He spoke very
good German, but I could see that he was a foreigner.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127'>127</a></span>
Before she showed him the room he asked
what kind of boarders she had, and she said, mostly
German officers. "Then there is no use for me to
look at the room," he answered, "I am an enemy
foreigner, and maybe it would not be pleasant."
"Oh, it would be all right," said the eager landlady,
"all you would have to do would be to report to the
police." "Oh, yes, I know," answered the man,
"I am <i><span lang="de_DE">sehr bekannt</span></i> (well known) to the police. I
am an Englishman."
</p>

<p>
Every prison camp has religious services according
to the religion of the prisoners. Prince Max
of Saxony likes to preach, and he goes around
preaching to the Russian prisoners in Russian. At
Wunsdorf and Zossen they have mosques where
the Mohammedan prisoners can hold their services.
</p>

<p>
Some of the officers' camps are at Klausthal and
Wildemann in the Harz, at Cologne, and at Mainz.
They have much better quarters than the common
soldiers. In some cases they have separate rooms,
and the meals are better and are served in better
style. They are even said to have napkins. The
officers never work for the Germans, but I have seen
pictures of them knitting and doing fancy work.
</p>

<p>
The youngest prisoners are some little Russian
boys from twelve to fourteen years of age. These
children were used as messenger boys to the Russian
officers and employed around the camp kitchens.
In the camps they are given a lesson in German
every day.

<h2>
VERBOTEN.
</h2>

<p>
In Germany nowadays&mdash;
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> to throw rubbish on the side walks
and streets.
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> to spit in public places.
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> for children and nurse girls to occupy
all the benches in the parks. Places must be
left for old people.
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> for children to play in the halls of
apartment houses. There are sand-boxes in the
rear for them.
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> for you to play your piano in an
apartment after ten o'clock at night. Other people
might want to sleep.
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> to make any unnecessary noises in
an apartment house at any time.
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> to take dogs into restaurants and
grocery stores.
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> to beat carpets on any day except
Friday or Saturday, and then it is forbidden to start
before eight o'clock. People in Germany don't have
brooms, they beat their carpets each week.
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> for customers to handle fruit on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129'>129</a></span>
the market stands. It is also forbidden to handle
poultry or game.
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> to sell short weights, and for this
the punishment is severe.
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> to put more people in a street car
than it can seat.
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> to take dogs into any train coupé
except the one marked "For dogs."
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> to put more people in an elevator
than it can hold.
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> to employ a man until he is old and
then to throw him out and give his place to a
younger man.
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> to employ women with very young
babies.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Since the war some new things have been added
to this list:
</p>

<p class="p2">
It is <i>verboten</i> to eat more food than is your share.
There must be enough for all.
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> for dealers to raise their prices on
the common necessary articles higher than those
fixed by the government.
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> to bake cakes and pastry at home.
The flour must be saved for bread.
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> to either sell or use cream. Cream
is a luxury, butter is a necessity.
</p>

<p>
It is <i>verboten</i> to dance during the war.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130'>130</a></span>
</p>

<p>
These are only a few rules laid down by the German
people for the German people. And they are
not only laid down but they are obeyed without question.
The power to obey laws shows strength and
not weakness, and it is this little word <i>verboten</i> that
the world has laughed at so much that is helping
Germany to win battles to-day.
</p>

<p>
For the Germans <i>verboten</i> means not only "forbidden,"
but it means self-restraint, obedience, and
the respect for the rights of others, and it means
unity as well,&mdash;the unity of working together, of
hearing commands given by those above and of
heeding those commands.
</p>

<p>
A German is quite as selfish as a person of any
other nation, and he is also quite as greedy, but
since the war he is forbidden to be greedy. He has
the inclination but he cannot carry it out. He can
buy only a certain amount of things each week and
that at a price so sternly fixed by the government
that a man's store is closed if he charges one cent
more than allowed. Also, he is not allowed to refuse
to sell things if he has them in stock, and the laws
are very strict about selling spoiled things. If a
butcher sells you spoiled meat and refuses to take
it back you can go to the police with your story. It
is <i>verboten</i> to sell bad meat.
</p>

<p>
The drink question had become a mighty one for
all the warring nations, but Germany, the greatest
beer-drinking country of the whole world, has
quietly settled the question without a fuss, and now
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131'>131</a></span>
since the war, the breweries are forbidden to retail
more than two-thirds of their output in peace times.
</p>

<p>
The Germans say that <i>verboten</i> is a part of patriotism,
for real patriotism consists in not only
loving your country but in serving it as well and in
having respect for its laws and the rights of other
men.

<h2>
THE MAIL IN GERMANY.
</h2>

<p>
In Germany, when a crowd of Americans got
together, we had but two topics of conversation&mdash;the
food and the mail.
</p>

<p>
The mail between Germany and America came
pretty regularly until February, 1916. Since that
time it is only a few straggling letters that have
gotten there at all. Even before America went into
the war, letters addressed to Germany direct were
held, but most people had a Holland or Scandinavian
address, and they had their letters relayed to
them. But even many of these letters did not get
through.
</p>

<p>
This relaying can still be done through Switzerland
but not through Scandinavia, as the Scandinavian
boats do not carry mail; and there is no
mail service between America and Scandinavia. The
relaying of letters is very expensive, and where before
the war it cost ten pfennigs to send a letter to
America on a German boat, by the relaying it costs
fifty pfennigs. The relaying is done in this way.
The letter is placed in an open envelope addressed
to the person in America. On the outside of this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133'>133</a></span>
envelope one fastens an International Coupon which
can be bought in any country. In Germany it
costs thirty pfennigs, and it can be exchanged in
any country for a five-cent stamp. A second open
envelope is placed over the first envelope with the
coupon attached. A twenty-pfennig stamp is placed
on this second envelope to take the letter out of the
country. The relayer takes the coupon and buys a
stamp with it in the neutral country where he is and
mails the letter. Sometimes these letters reach their
destination.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
The German censor seldom opens a letter that
has already been opened by the English censor, but
they open all letters marked Holland or Denmark
or Switzerland. Letters sent out of Germany must
be mailed open, and it is better to write on one side
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134'>134</a></span>
of the paper so that if the censor takes it into his
head to clip, only one side of the paper is spoiled.
If the German censor thinks that a letter is too long
he sends it back and tells you to make it shorter.
</p>

<p>
Until America entered the war, newspapers sent
out by newspaper offices to firms in Germany generally
got there, but papers sent to private people
were usually held up. The American papers were
about two months old. I received several letters
nine months old. An American I know received
two letters in the same mail. One was dated June,
1914, and announced the marriage of a friend of
his in Chicago. The second letter was dated July,
1915, and it was a card telling of the birth of a boy
to the couple.
</p>

<p>
On the 1st of February, 1917, it was advertised
in all the German newspapers that any one wishing
to send mail by the <span lang="de_DE">U-Deutschland</span> could do so by
paying two marks extra postage, and that all the
letters should be in the post office by the 15th of
February. Many people sent letters. On the 5th
of February, America broke off relations with Germany,
so the boat did not sail. Along in March
all the people who had sent letters received their
two marks back with their letter and the information
that the boat had not sailed and that there was
now no mail service between America and Germany.

Before the war Germany had the finest mail system
in the world, letters came more quickly, they
had more deliveries and not so many letters were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135'>135</a></span>
lost. Now since so many of the clerks are new and
many of them are women, the service is not as efficient
as it was. One often loses letters.
</p>

<p>
The first mail delivery in Germany comes at 7.30
in the morning and the last delivery is at 8 o'clock
at night, and there are many more in between. Then
they have what they call their <i>Rohrpost</i> letters and
these are the special delivery letters, and they are
shot through a tube from one post office to another
and are delivered by a boy at the other end. Now
a good many of the special delivery messengers are
women.

<i>Berlin Mail Carriers.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The most extensive mail in Germany is the <i>Feldpost</i>
or the soldiers' mail. It does not cost anything
to send a letter to a soldier or for a soldier to send
a letter to you. All you have to do is to put the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137'>137</a></span>
word <i>Feldpost</i> at the top of the letter and it goes
free. Even if you know where a soldier is, you do
not put the name of the place on the envelope, only
his field address which consists of the army corps,
the regiment and the company of the soldier.

<i>Mail Wagons on the West Front.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
A one-pound package can be sent to the soldiers
for twenty pfennigs. Thousands and thousands of
packages are sent each day. Just before I left Berlin
it was forbidden to send a soldier packages of
food, as the soldiers in the field had better rations
than the German civilian population. Many soldiers
sent their families packages of food. I visited a
German family in Dresden in May, 1917, just the
month before I left Germany, and every day while
I was there they received a package of food from
the son who was an officer in Hungary.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138'>138</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In the summer of 1916, the prices of postage
stamps were raised in Germany. Letters that had
before cost five pfennigs now cost seven and one-half
pfennigs, and letters that cost ten pfennigs,
now cost fifteen pfennigs. The price was not changed
on the letters going out of Germany. Some of the
people rather grumbled and said: "It now costs
fifteen pfennigs to send a letter from Potsdam to
Berlin and only twenty pfennigs to send a letter
from Germany to America."

<p>
It does not take nearly as long for a letter to go
to a soldier in France as it takes to go to a soldier
in Russia. A letter sometimes comes in one day
from the Somme to Berlin, but from Russia a letter
takes four or five days at the least.
</p>

<p>
All the mail that goes to the soldiers on the west
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139'>139</a></span>
front is first sent to Hanover to a central station.
Here the mail is sorted and sent to different stations
along the front. From these main stations the mail
is sent to different sub-stations. Every day each
regiment sends a soldier to its sub-branch for the

head of the sub-branch knows where the mail is to
go, for each regiment's whereabouts are kept a
secret.

<h2>
THE "<span lang="de_DE">AUSLÄNDEREI</span>"
</h2>

<p>
In Germany, one evening last winter I heard a
German count give a lecture on the <i><span lang="de_DE">Ausländerei</span></i>.
He started out by saying that for years the German
people had been suffering from a disease called <i><span lang="de_DE">Ausländerei</span></i>,
which means that they have always been
too fond of all that is foreign, that they have been
ashamed of being Germans, and that they have
tried to copy the manner, modes and customs of other
nations instead of sticking to their own national
ideals.
</p>

<p>
He went into detail, beginning with the foreign
names used all over Germany. He said that instead
of a hotel being called by the good old-fashioned
German word <i>Hof</i>, the hotel proprietors insisted
on using the word "hotel," combined, alas, too often
with such words as Bristol, Excelsior, Continental,
Esplanade, Carlton, Westminster and Savoy. He
thought that much better words would be <i><span lang="de_DE">Berlinerhof</span></i>
or <i><span lang="de_DE">Kaiserhof</span></i>.
</p>

<p>
He said that until three years ago messenger
boys were called by the English name "messenger
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141'>141</a></span>
boys," and he much preferred the new name <i><span lang="de_DE">Blitzjunge</span></i>
which means "lightning kid."
</p>

<p>
He lamented that even now English clothes for
men were still being sold in German shops, and that
they were quoted as English and were bought because
they were English; that German women still
follow Paris fashions; but he said with emphasis:
"A German heart under a Paris gown is no true
German heart." He said that a man who studied
in England liked to be styled "an Oxford man" or
"a Cambridge man," and that many a German
woman who goes to Switzerland each year registers
at the fashionable hotels as "Madame Schultz" or
"Madame Schmidt" instead of "Frau."
</p>

<p>
He said further that when an Englishman or an
American came to Germany, he fully expected every
German he met to know English, but no traveling
German expects any one to know German, and the
German meekly learns the languages of all the other
races.
</p>

<p>
He ended by saying that he knew that no people
had a greater love for their country than the German
people have, and that the time had come for
them to cease their imitations and to be Germans
without foreign ideals, thoughts or customs.
</p>

<p>
It is said that in Königsberg the military commander
there has made it a criminal offense for
any one to use or circulate a foreign fashion plate.
There are also a small number of people who think
that English or French should not be spoken on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142'>142</a></span>
streets during the war, although English and French
are still being taught in the schools, and I often saw
youngsters studying their English lessons on the
trains.
</p>

<p>
But I have found that the count, the military
commander at Königsberg, and the people who
want nothing but German spoken on the streets
represent only a small portion of the German people;
the whole cry of the masses is for peace to come,
so that they can have things from the outside world
again.
</p>

<p>
During the two years that I was in Berlin I
talked English on the streets nearly all the time,
and I was spoken to only twice for talking English.
Once I went to Potsdam with an American boy, and
we were sitting in the train waiting for it to start.
We thought the train was empty, and we were
talking English very fast and rather loud. Suddenly
a woman in black poked her head around from the
next coupé and asked us to stop talking English.
"It hurts me," she said, "the English killed my
husband."
</p>

<p>
Another time I was talking to an American lady
at the opera, when a pinched-faced German lady
turned around in front of us and said, "Don't you
know that this is the Royal German Opera House
and that we are at war with England?" She thought
we were English. We said nothing but commenced
to speak German.
</p>

<p>
A funny thing happened to an American lady I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143'>143</a></span>
knew. She was dining with a Turkish officer dressed
in civilian clothes. As the Turk knew no German
they were talking French. A nervous wounded
German officer came in and seated himself at a table
near them. As soon as he heard the French he
sent the waiter over to tell them to stop. The Turk
took his military calling-card out of his pocket and
sent it over to the German. The German officer did
the only thing there was to do&mdash;he came over and
apologized.
</p>

<p>
Once in a while in Berlin we were cut off the
telephone when we spoke English. This was a spy
precaution, and Central would not connect us again
even when we spoke German.
</p>

<p>
In Cologne a number of dressmakers had a meeting
to establish some new styles for Germany. They
dug up a lot of fashion plates from the styles fifty
years back, and had fashion plates printed from
them and model dresses made, and they tried to
convince the modern German girl that this was
what she should wear. They called the new style
the <i><span lang="de_DE">Reform-Kleid</span></i> or "reform dress," but their
scheme was not much of a success, for if anything
was ever ugly it was this dress. I never saw more
than half a dozen of these dresses on the street, but
once at a club I saw a number of them. They were
made with a narrow skirt and a loose Russian blouse
for a waist. They were absolutely shapeless and
so were the women that were in them. The dresses
were mostly made of flowered silk and very little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144'>144</a></span>
trimmed. The hat that went with the reform costume
was perfectly plain and fitted down over the
head like a pan.
</p>

<p>
The <i><span lang="de_DE">Reform-Kleid</span></i> is the butt of many a joke in
the German weeklies, and the German girls I know
said that they would die before they would wear
them. Very wide skirts are the style in Germany,
and the government has tried to make women wear
narrower ones because of the amount of cloth it
takes, but a woman's patriotism ceases where styles
are concerned, and they all manage to get the needed
cloth for their skirts.
</p>

<p>
Germany has been cut off from the world so long
that her styles are different from the rest of the
world. Even the Scandinavian people dress more
like Americans. In Germany, very short-vamped,
round-toed shoes are the style; you couldn't buy a
pair of pointed shoes there. Last summer an American
girl came over from the United States, and she
had been told beforehand to bring shoes. She brought
eleven pairs of pointed ones, and every time she
went out the Germans stared at her feet. The German
hats sit high from the head, and short sleeves
are once more in fashion.
</p>

<p>
All the German women will be glad when they
can have Paris fashions again, and most German
men try to dress like Englishmen. They love English
tweed and they think that there is nothing like
a Burberry coat. Many of the German officers wear
a monocle and this is surely English.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145'>145</a></span>
</p>

<p>
One old German fogey wanted to have all the
letters on the German typewriters changed to German
script. But even at the mention of such a thing
the merchants and business men rose up and said
they would never have it. Café Piccadilly changed
its name to Café Vaterland, but the Russischer Hof
is still so called, and the highest order in the German
army is still called <i><span lang="fr_FR">Pour le mérite</span></i>.
</p>

<p>
Of course you hear a lot of talk about <i>echt
deutsche</i> things, and that now nothing is worth
anything unless it is "made in Germany" and is
pure German. They call that patriotism, but the
far-thinking German realizes that it is the <i><span lang="de_DE">Ausländerei</span></i>
that keeps a nation young, and it was that
which made Germany what she was before the war.
The count said that the Germans were "copy cats"&mdash;but
was not this one of the cleverest things about
the German nation?

<h2>
WAR CHARITIES.
</h2>

<p>
Almost every day is tag day in Berlin. You
can't poke your head out of the door without
a collection-box being shoved at you. Boys and
girls work at this eternally. They go through the
trains and the cafés and restaurants, not one at a
time but in steady streams. You may be walking
along a very quiet street and you will see a lady
come smiling toward you. Apparently she is empty-handed,
but just as she comes up to you, she whisks
a box out from behind her muff or newspaper and
politely begs a mite.
</p>

<p>
The Germans give unceasingly to these collections.
They put in only ten pfennigs at a time, but
I have often watched men and women in the cafés,
and they will give to half a dozen youngsters in
half an hour. They really prefer to give their charity
donations in this way instead of in a large lump.
They get more pleasure out of it.
</p>

<p>
The day just before I left Berlin for Copenhagen,
I had been pestered about ten times in one square.
The collection was called the <i><span lang="de_DE">U-Boot-Spende</span></i>, and
it was a collection for the wives and children of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147'>147</a></span>
sailors who had lost their lives on the U-boats. At
one corner a boy of about thirteen years stopped
me by raising his hat and asking if he dared beg a
few pfennigs for the <i><span lang="de_DE">U-Boot-Spende</span></i>.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
"Now, look here," I said to him, "Why should I
give to this? I am a <i><span lang="de_DE">feindliche Ausländerin</span></i> (an
enemy foreigner) and if I give you any money it
encourages you Germans to go on sinking American
ships. I must save my money for the wives and the
children of the men who have lost their lives by the
U-boats."

<p>
The boy blushed deeply. "That is true," he said,
"I beg your pardon. I feel for those people too.
And if you will allow me I would like to donate
something for your charity," and the little fellow
pulled a mark out of his pocket and handed it to me.
I found out afterwards that the boy was the son
of one of Germany's richest and most aristocratic
princes.
</p>

<p>
Besides the tag days there are many women
who go around selling little picture sheets for ten
pfennigs. Countless numbers of these sheets have
sprung up since the war. The companies that publish
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150'>150</a></span>
them make only a small profit and the rest of
the money goes to charity.
</p>

<p>
One of the best ways the Germans have of collecting
money is the driving of nails into wooden
statues and charging so much to each person for
being allowed to drive a nail. The "Iron Hindenburg"
is the greatest of all these figures, but there
are many more even in Berlin. Many cafés have
their own figures to nail, sometimes it is only an
eagle or an Iron Cross. In Brandenburg they have
a wooden copy of their famous old stone statue of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151'>151</a></span>
Roland that has stood for centuries in the Brandenburg
market place. The stone figure was funny
and quaint enough, but the nailed figure looks like
some queer product of cubist art.

<p>
The <i>Mittelstandsküche</i> and the <i>Volksküche</i> are
also charitable organizations and are run by
women's clubs. These kitchens are places where
the middle and lower class people can get a good
meal for from fifty to seventy pfennigs,&mdash;a meal
consisting of soup, meat, potatoes and a vegetable.
Compote or stewed fruit can be bought for ten
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152'>152</a></span>
pfennigs a dish, and salad can be bought for the
same price. They do not have bread, you must
bring that with you. They cut off your food cards
for meat and potatoes, but they are not very strict
about it. If you were terribly hungry and went to
a <i>Volksküche</i> you could very likely get something
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153'>153</a></span>
to eat without a card. The city sees that these
places are well provided for, and often you could
not get potatoes in the fashionable restaurants, but
the kitchens always had them.

<p>
Besides these kitchens, club women have a traveling
soup kitchen. It consists of a goulash cannon
driven around the streets on a wagon, and the people
come with their buckets to get a hot stew for thirty-five
pfennigs.
</p>

<p>
The American Chamber of Commerce had a fine
soup kitchen in Berlin. It was opened two winters
ago with great pomp, and Mr. and Mrs. Gerard
were present at the occasion. Society ladies took
turns helping in the kitchen, and they made it a
very great success. Everything served in the kitchen
was free and the food was splendid. They served
many hundred people each day.
</p>

<p>
In Munich the Americans have a hospital which
they conduct themselves. I don't know how it is
run since America got into the war, but before this
time the Americans paid for everything. Two years
ago the American ladies in Dresden had a bazar
for the German Red Cross. They made many thousand
marks. In Berlin there is a very rich American
man who keeps the families of one hundred
and fifty German soldiers that have been killed in
the war. When America got into the war, it was
thought that his charity would end, but he said,
"No, these poor women and children cannot help it
that America is in the war."

<i>Frau Becker's Children Out for a Walk.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
One of the greatest charitable organizations in
Berlin is a day nursery run by Frau Hofrat Becker.
The nursery is where the working wives of soldiers
can leave their babies each day while they are at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155'>155</a></span>
work. No children can be left with Frau Becker
unless the mother shows a certificate that she works.
The children can be left at five o'clock in the morning
and they are kept there until night.
</p>

<p>
Frau Becker has five of these homes located in
different parts of Berlin, and I have visited all of
them. In each home she has about one hundred and
fifty children&mdash;little babies from six weeks old up
to four years of age. Some of the children seemed
very happy but others were pinched looking little
things who looked as though the battle of life was
too great for them. The babies are given milk and
bread for breakfast and at noon a warm stew.
</p>

<p>
Besides taking care of the babies, Frau Becker
gives the older children who go to school a warm
noon-day meal, and after school she gives them
coffee or bread. Then she provides these larger
children with employments and amusements so they
will be kept off the streets. The larger girls sew
and knit, and the boys learn songs and games. All
the helpers are voluntary, and they receive no pay.

<p>
Nearly every family in Germany of the better
middle class have what they call a <i><span lang="de_DE">Kriegskind</span></i>, or a
"war child." They take a boy or girl of some poor
family and give them their meals. The family
where I visited in Dresden had had a little girl since
the beginning of the war. When the war broke
out, Hilda was nine years old, and you cannot imagine
what a change has taken place in her during
the three years. She has now very nice manners,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157'>157</a></span>
she is very clean and she has learned to sew and
play the piano. Hilda is one of a family of eleven
children. The father is a <i><span lang="de_DE">Landsturm</span></i> man in the
war, and he makes thirty-eight pfennigs a day.
</p>

<p>
One of the greatest charity collections is the gold-collection.
The Empress started this collection by
giving a lot of gold ornaments, and many people
have followed her example. The story goes around
in Germany&mdash;personally I doubt if it is true&mdash;that
the Crown Princess gave to the collection all the
gold plates that King Edward of England had given
her for a wedding present, and when the plates were
melted down they were all found to be plated.

<h2>
WHAT GERMANY IS DOING FOR HER
HUMAN WAR WRECKS.
</h2>

<p>
The word "cripple" is a word that hurts, and
in Germany when one speaks of the men who
have lost arms, legs, or eyes, they say <i><span lang="de_DE">Kriegsbeschädigte</span></i>,
which means hurt or damaged by the war.
It has a softer sound.
</p>

<p>
Even now, with the war not over, plans have been
carried out for these men and many more plans are
being made. Skilful doctors and makers of artificial
limbs are contriving all sorts of ways to make
various kinds of arms and legs that are suited for
all kinds of work that a crippled man might wish
to do.
</p>

<p>
For instance, a man who wishes to be a carpenter
must have a different kind of a hook on his
new hand from that of the man who wishes to be
a blacksmith. The man who has lost his arm at
the shoulder must have a different hook from the
man who has lost his at the elbow.

</p>
</div>

<p>
All this means much experimenting as there are
so many different trades in the world, and the
crippled man wishes if possible to follow the same
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160'>160</a></span>
trade he had before the war. In many cases it is
not possible to do this, and there have been mapped
out fifty-one new trades at which crippled men can
work. The government has established schools
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162'>162</a></span>
where these trades can be learned without any
charge to the soldier.

<p>
One of the most famous of these schools is in
Berlin, the Oscar-Helene-Heim. Before the war
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164'>164</a></span>
this was a hospital for crippled children with a
school for them where they could learn trades. Since
the war they have made additions to the place, and
soldiers can go here to learn a trade. The head of
this institution is Professor Biesalski, the man who
has invented many of the different kinds of arms
and legs. The Biesalski arm is very simple and
is made out of nickel, and tools fasten into the
holder with screws.

I went all through this home. They have a carpentry
department, a shoe-making department, a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165'>165</a></span>
basket-weaving department, and a gardening department.
There were a number of soldiers here
without legs, but the home makes a specialty of
helping soldiers without arms, and this is the far
more difficult task. I saw some men with both arms
gone, and in these sad cases they have implements
for holding everything, tools, knives, forks, spoons,
cups, cigars and indeed everything that a man would
want to hold.

<p>
The artificial legs are also most wonderful. One
army captain who had lost his leg at the thigh was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166'>166</a></span>
able to mount his horse nine weeks after his leg
had been amputated, and two weeks later he joined
his regiment in the field. Another chap just nineteen
years of age and who had lost his leg, enlisted
in the aviation squad, and now he is one of the best
flyers in the German army.

<p>
However, most of the men do not return to war
but settle down to peaceful labors. One soldier, a
shoemaker by trade, found that he could make just
as good shoes with one foot as with two. Another
case was that of a soldier who had lost both legs at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167'>167</a></span>
Liège. He was an engineer by trade and now he
is running the fast train between Cologne and Brussels.
A tailor had both feet cut off. The new feet
made for him were very big and now he can tread
the sewing machine as well as before.

The most successful hand made since the war
was not "Made in Germany" but "Made in America."
A famous Berlin surgeon, Dr. Max Cohen,
became infected from the wound of a soldier whom
he was dressing at the beginning of the war. The
infection became so bad that it was necessary to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168'>168</a></span>
amputate his left hand. He sent to America for a
new hand. It is made so that the fingers have joints
like a real hand, and these joints bend and work
like the joints of a real hand. The joints are operated
by pulleys fastened at the shoulder. The hand
can not only hold things, but can lift a fifty-pound
article and can carry lighter weight articles. With
his good right hand and the aid of this left hand,
Dr. Cohen can still carry on his operations, and
they are as successful as before.

All over Germany they have exhibitions of dummies

with artificial arms and legs to show their
workings. One dummy was a figure at a sewing
machine, and it showed how artificial legs could
do the treading. The men can go to these exhibitions
and pick out the kind of an arm or leg that
suits them.

<p>
Perhaps the hardest task of the war is the educating
of the blind soldiers, for they are more or
less helpless, and they are apt to become despondent.
In Berlin they have established a hospital and a
school for blind soldiers. It is called the St. Maria
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170'>170</a></span>
Victoria Hospital. The whole inspiration of this
school is a blind woman, Fräulein Betty Hirsch.
When the war broke out she was in England studying
the English methods of dealing with the blind,
and she has charge of all the training of the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
From the very beginning it was Fräulein Hirsch's
ambition that her blind soldiers should not have the
old monotonous trades of basket-making and broom-making.
She wanted them to have a broader field
of activity in the world, and so she visited all the
factories in Berlin to find out what work a blind
man can do. She has her soldiers trained to fill
these positions. Now she has forty-five blind men
in good munition factory positions, and they work
from six to eight hours a day. At first they received
45 pfennigs an hour wages, but this was increased
to fifty-five pfennigs an hour. Some of the men put
cartridges into frames, and others fill cartridges
into pockets. Every night the workers come home
to the hospital where they are housed and cared for
free.
</p>

<p>
Every morning from eleven to twelve o'clock the
men are given their lessons, and the rest of the day
they spend practising them. They learn typewriting
and how to become telephone centrals. I saw
one young fellow there who had lost both eyes at
Verdun. He had been studying typewriting four
months and he could take a dictation like a person
with sight.
</p>

<p>
It is forbidden to use a dictagraph in Germany,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171'>171</a></span>
but Fräulein Hirsch got permission to use it for
the blind people. As they had none of these instruments
in Germany, Fräulein Hirsch copied the English
model and had them made at her dictation.
</p>

<p>
One of the blind soldiers here has invented an
attachment to the typewriter that holds the machine
fast when the end of the paper is reached. It is
very hard for a blind person to tell when the end
of the paper is reached, and they are very apt to go
on ticking after the page is done. This invention
is a rod with a screw in the front and will undoubtedly
be used by the blind typists all over the
world.
</p>

<p>
Another trade the soldiers are taught is cigarette
making. German cigarettes are not rolled but the
tobacco is stuffed into papers that come already
fastened together. The blind men learn this very
quickly.
</p>

<p>
Every province in Germany now issues a pamphlet
each week to help the crippled men. These
pamphlets are called "From War to Work in Peace,"
and they contain everything that would interest a
crippled man, trades they can pursue, things that
they can make if they prefer to stay at home, and
where they can sell what they make. They also
contain advertisements for employment for crippled
men.
</p>

<p>
Near Berlin they have a farm for one-legged
men, and here the one-legged soldiers can go to
live and farm. Most of the farmers are men without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172'>172</a></span>
families, and they intend to live on the farm all
the rest of their days.
</p>

<p>
The German government has drawn up plans to
build houses for the crippled men. Sites have been
selected and plans have been completed. The houses
are to be built near factories where work will be
carried on that a crippled man can do. The plans
for these houses are very attractive. Some of the
houses are single houses, cottage effects with slanting
roofs and a little garden. In each settlement
there will be a number of large apartment houses,
and then one very large house like a hotel where the
unmarried men can live.
</p>

<p>
The rental of these houses will be astonishingly
low. For instance a room for a bachelor in the
large house will cost from twenty to thirty dollars
a year. This includes light and heat, and in some
cases furniture. An apartment in the large apartment
house will cost from seventy-five to one hundred
dollars a year with light and heat. The single
houses will be more expensive and will cost about
one hundred and fifty dollars a year. Each apartment
in the large house will have a little garden,
and there will be cafés and libraries where the men
and their families can enjoy themselves.
</p>

<p>
No man is happy unless he has work to do, and
the Germans are doing everything that is possible,
so that the future will not look too black to the crippled
German soldier when he comes home from war.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173'>173</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
WILL THE WOMEN OF GERMANY SERVE
A YEAR IN THE ARMY?
</h2>

<p>
The greatest question before the German women
is not, Shall they have the right to vote? but,
Would it not be better for them if they had one
year's special training by the Government as do the
men when they serve their time in the army?
</p>

<p>
Compulsory military service has been a fine thing
for men in the countries where it is enforced, and
this is especially so of Germany where the men are
inclined to be fond of studies rather than of sports
and exercise. It makes them physically stronger,
they are taught correct ways to exercise, and the
way to care for their health.
</p>

<p>
And so this war has brought to the German
women the consciousness that they, too, must have
some practice and training in things, if they wish
to fulfil their duty to their families and their country.
They realize how much better they could do
all the things that they are now forced to do if they
had had some special training beforehand. And so
the great question has come up: Shall the women of
Germany have a year's training by the State?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174'>174</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Many of the greatest women of Germany are for
this issue, and they have worked out plans for the
service. All this does not mean that the women will
have to learn to shoot guns and cannons, but that
they shall be trained in the branches that make a
more perfect womanhood and motherhood.

<i>Society Women Helping the Poor Children.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The women will be divided into two classes for
their army year&mdash;the first class being the higher
and more educated German girls, and the second
class being the poorer girls who must earn their own
living. Naturally, the rich girl who stays at home
would not be taught the same branches as a poor girl.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177'>177</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The better class girls will pay for their year of
service. Buildings would have to be built for them,
complete in every equipment, where they could live
during that year. The other girls would be taught
in the public schools, and their training would be
free, the State paying for everything&mdash;clothes, food
and training.
</p>

<p>
The most important thing for the women to learn
in their year would be housekeeping. Not merely
the keeping of the house in order, such as sweeping,
dusting and scrubbing and all the branches that go
with housekeeping. They must learn cooking, not
only cooking for strong healthy people, but things
that sick people can eat. They must learn to prepare
food for infants. They must learn to do washing
and ironing, and they must learn to make a bed
properly.
</p>

<p>
They must learn to do scientific marketing, so
that they will know what to buy without wasting,
for <i><span lang="de_DE">Sparsamkeit</span></i>, i. e., economy, is one of the fundamental
things to learn. They will be taught what
to do when there is no fat to be had, and they will
be given different menus for times when certain
foods are scarce.
</p>

<p>
Then the German women will be taught how to
make a garden, when to plant different seeds and
what grows best in certain seasons. Chicken raising
will be taught to the girls who care to know
about it, and for the country girls there will be
training in the making of dairy products.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179'></a></span>

<p class="caption">
<i>Society Women Learning to Cook.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
After housekeeping the next important thing is
nursing. The women must learn to take care of the
sick, how to make bandages, and perhaps some
knowledge of medicine. If this branch is distasteful
to any of the women they will not be compelled to
pursue it very far, but for those who like the branch
they can continue it until they become graduate
nurses.
</p>

<p>
The second branch of nursing which every girl
must learn thoroughly is taking care of infants.
They must be taught the proper dressing for young
babies, what babies must eat and when they must
sleep. Also they must know what to do in cases of
light infants' diseases and what to do for fussy
babies and for teething babies.
</p>

<p>
Then they must learn something of social settlement
work, and how to entertain sick and crippled
children. They must help in the care of orphans
and be able to make things for them. They must
know something of kindergartening and know
stories and games for children. Many German
women who have lost their husbands in the war will
be glad to have a place to send their children, and
the army girls can take care of them.
</p>

<p>
After nursing come lessons in sewing, and besides
the making of the common things the better class
of girls will learn to make lace and to do fancy work.
In the year's service the better class girls will sew
for the poor and the poorer girls will sew for themselves.

<p>
One prominent German woman thinks that it
would be a good plan to have the girls serve their
first half year of service at the age of fourteen,
when they leave public school. At this time they
would be taught house-keeping and cooking. Then,
later, between the age of seventeen and twenty
when it is most convenient to the girls they could
do their second half year.
</p>

<p>
Nursing, sewing and cooking will be the main
branches taught to the better class girls, but each
of the poorer girls will be taught a special branch
by which she can earn her own living, and something
she can use in filling the places of the men
when it is necessary, as in this war.
</p>

<p>
The better grade of the poorer girls will be taught
book-keeping and typewriting. They will be taught
to be telephone operators, and how to wait on customers
properly. But a girl will be taught only one
of these branches, and she will be allowed to choose
the one that she likes best.
</p>

<p>
Of course most German girls get married, but
they must have some specialty to fall back on in
case of the men going to war, or in the case of the
loss of a husband, when they may be left with many
little children to support. When a girl has learned
any specialty she must serve the State in that capacity
whenever she is called upon to do so. That will
be her duty, the same as a man's.

<i>A Home for Soldiers' Babies.</i>

<p>
The plan so far is to have everything managed
by women, and they are to have officers the same
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182'>182</a></span>
as the army. This will make the bright women
more efficient in management and the duller women
will learn to obey.
</p>

<p>
Already the society women of Germany have
formed clubs for learning to do things. They are
learning to make gardens, to cook and to sew.
Women are now being drafted for the munition
factories, and as most of these girls have before
been housemaids, many German housewives are
thrown upon their own resources.
</p>

<p>
That most of the German women would be benefitted
by a year's training cannot be denied. It
would help to make them stronger in body and in
mind. This war has been a great example to the
world of what military training means to the men,
and the women of Germany feel that if they must
do the work of a man, they should have the same
benefits as a man.

<h2>
THE KAISERIN AND THE HOHENZOLLERN
PRINCESSES.
</h2>

<p>
The most popular man in Germany is the Kaiser,
and the Kaiserin is the most popular
woman. William II may have his critics, but no
one can deny that in him Augusta Victoria has
found what she considers an ideal husband. The
only domestic tyranny that I heard of his engaging
in is, that every birthday he gives the Kaiserin
twelve hats for a present. These hats he picks out
himself, and she has to wear them. From the pictures
one sees of the Kaiserin wearing a hat one
does feel that he is a sort of barbarian and rather
rough on his wife. On her last birthday when I
was in Berlin, she would allow no gifts to be given
her&mdash;perhaps she wanted one year without hats&mdash;and
instead, she requested all the givers to send
wine, jams and preserves to the soldiers. This collection
was called the Kaiserin's birthday gift.
</p>

<p class="caption">
<i>The Kaiserin of Germany.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Except for the present war, the life and reign
of Augusta Victoria has been a peaceful one, and
it is now twenty-eight years since she became the
first lady in the land. She was born in the little
castle of Dolzig in Schleswig-Holstein, and there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185'>185</a></span>
she spent her childhood with her two younger sisters
and her brother. The young Prince Wilhelm of
Prussia, the present Kaiser, was a half cousin of
the young Princess, their mothers being half sisters.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187'>187</a></span>
Prince Wilhelm had seen her but once at an English
court party given by a mutual relative, and it
was not until he was invited to a hunting-party at
her father's castle that they became acquainted.

<p>
The hunting-party was in 1878, and it brought
a great booty. The story goes that after the hunt
the young Prince was walking in the garden when
suddenly he came upon the young Princess&mdash;that
was the beginning of the courtship, and a year later
they were married. When Bismarck heard the news
he exclaimed, "A happy ending to a kingdom's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188'>188</a></span>
drama." Bismarck had probably arranged the
match, for Schleswig-Holstein was restless and
needed to be bound more securely to the states of
Germany.

The Prince and Princess entered Berlin through

Wilhelm I died, and less than a year later his son
died, and Kaiser Wilhelm II and Augusta Victoria
ascended the throne.
</p>

<p>
On the 6th of May, 1882, the present Crown-Prince
was born. His father was so excited that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189'>189</a></span>
he opened the window of the Marble Palace and
yelled across to his father's palace, "Father, it is a
boy. Hurrah! The fourth German Kaiser!" The
child was christened with the full name of Friedrich
Wilhelm Victor August Ernst.

<p>
After this came five more boys, one after the
other&mdash;Eitel Friedrich on July 7, 1883; Adalbert
on July 14, 1884; August Wilhelm on January 29,
1887; Oskar on July 6, 1888; and Joachim on December
17, 1890. The youngest child was a daughter,
Victoria Louise, born on September 13, 1892.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190'>190</a></span>
</p>

<p>
All the children are now married, and strange
to say every one of them has married a German,
and all of royal blood except the wife of Prince
Oskar, and she was a baroness.

The wedding of the Crown Prince and the
Duchess Cecilia of Mecklenburg-Schwerin took
place on June 6, 1905. The Crown Princess has
very high connections, coming from the same family
as the famous Queen Louise. Her mother is a
Russian Princess, and she is a first cousin to the
late Czar. Her sister is the Queen of Denmark,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191'>191</a></span>
and when she goes to Denmark to pay a visit to her
sister, the two walk through the streets of Copenhagen
arm in arm with the king.

<p class="caption">
<i>Princess Joachim, Wife of Sixth Son.</i>

</div>

<p>
Her democratic spirit has made her very popular
with the German people, and she is said to be the
one person who dares to defy her imperial father-in-law,
and as a result he admires her very much and
is very fond of her. Four years ago, the Kaiser
forbade the officers to tango. The very next day
after this edict the Crown Princess hired a tango
teacher. The Kaiser only laughed. He liked her spirit.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192'>192</a></span>
</p>

<p>
She is very tall, almost as tall as her tall husband.
She is almost of the Russian type and has dark
hair and very bright eyes. The German women
look to her to set the styles. She dresses a great
deal in white and like the Kaiserin wears very large
hats. Although very rich in her own right she does
not wear extravagant clothes but rather sensible
things.

boys and her little daughter, helping to train them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193'>193</a></span>
herself. The eldest boy is now ten years old, and
the little girl was born since the war. She has her
own palace in Berlin, but she spends most of her
time at Potsdam or at Danzig, the favorite resort
of the royal pair.
</p>

<p>
At the silver wedding of the Kaiser and Kaiserin,
Prince Eitel Friedrich and the Grand Duchess Charlotte
of Oldenburg were married. The Duchess is
a grand-daughter of Prince Carl, the famous general
of 1870. She is quite different from the vivacious
Cecilia, being of a quiet temperament. She
has no children.
</p>

<p>
A year later the fourth son of the Kaiser, Prince
August Wilhelm, was married to Princess Alexandra
Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein. She is so pretty
that they call her the "Beautiful Princess." Almost
any day one can see her riding around in her carriage
with her little boy at her side. She is a first
cousin to her husband, being a daughter of the favorite
sister of the Kaiserin. She is by far the favorite
daughter-in-law of the Kaiserin's, and the two are
often seen together. Her child is a beautiful boy of
four years. Both she and the child are very often
photographed.
</p>

<p>
Prince Adalbert, the third son, was the next to
be married, and in 1911 he married Princess Adelheid
of Saxe-Meiningen. Princess Adelheid is a
very sad princess, for since her marriage she has
lost both her parents. She has no children.

Louise, who has always been very popular in Germany.
She is the Kaiser's favorite child and he
always said that his only daughter should marry
whom she pleased. When she picked August of
Brunswick every one was satisfied, for it settled
for once and all the Guelph claim to the Brunswick
throne. The Germans like to believe that this was
a love match, for they do not like to think that their
dear little Princess Victoria Louise was sacrificed to
the plans of the State, but on all sides you hear
rumors that she is not happy and that her husband
is always "away," and "away" doesn't mean at the
front either, for they say he doesn't care much for
fighting. She has two children. She spends most
of her time in Brunswick, but sometimes she meets
her husband in Berlin, and they go to either the
Adlon or Bristol Hotel.
</p>

<p>
The fifth son, Prince Oskar, was morganatically
married in 1914 to the Baroness von Rippen, a
beautiful and high-minded lady with whom he was
very much in love. Of all the royal ladies she has
the most charming face. At first the Kaiser wasn't
very keen on this marriage, but when the war broke
out he gave his consent. They have one baby born
in 1916.
</p>

<p>
The youngest son was married in the spring of
1916, and the wedding of Prince Joachim and the
Princess Marie of Anhalt was a quiet war marriage.
This summer a boy was born.

A STROLL THROUGH BERLIN.
</h2>

<p>
When you start your stroll through Berlin,
you begin at Friedrichstrasse Station, for
everything begins there and ends there for that
matter. Here is the elevated that takes you all
around the city, and the long-distance railway that
takes you all around the world.
</p>

<p>
From the station you hurry down two squares of
Friedrichstrasse, and there you are right on Unter
den Linden, the heart of Berlin. Linden trees! Linden
trees! But they are all bare now, and the lights
from the other side of the street show through their
empty coal-black branches. But on days when there
has been a victory, flags show through, and then the
street is very beautiful.
</p>

<p>
The center of Berlin is built on a square. On one
side is Unter den Linden, on the second side Friedrichstrasse,
on the third side Leipzigerstrasse and
on the last side Wilhelmstrasse. Unter den Linden
is all fashionable shops and hotels. Here is the
Hotel Adlon where most Americans stop, but the
German royalty go there as well. The Duchess of
Brunswick often makes this her headquarters. Near

the hotel is a newspaper office, the <i><span lang="de_DE">Lokal-Anzeiger</span></i>.
It always has a crowd of people hanging around its
bulletins, and its great war map which shows with
colored pins how Germany has advanced her boundaries.
Then there are jewelry and men's furnishing
shops. This is the promenade side of the street,
and here the Beau Brummels and Disraelis of Berlin
walk with their fine ladies. Some of them take
tea at Kranzler's, and the little cake house is packed
from early morn till night. People sitting in Kranzler's
never look at ease but as though they were
there to be seen and not to have a good time.
</p>

<p>
On the other side of the street in the midst of all
this fashionable array is a tiny little beer hall for
soldiers. They always have a ham and a dozen of
eggs in the window, and beside the ham the sign
"<i><span lang="de_DE">Bier für Militär 10 Pfennige</span></i>," and what soldier
would not take advantage of this! On the same
side is the "Jockey Club," tailors who make English
clothes. The words "Jockey Club" are printed all
over the front of the store. There is only one empty
store on the street, and that is a tiny shop, and the
signs are still in the window: "Chevalier d'Orsay
Perfume." The French shop-keepers left at the beginning
of the war. The "Mercedes Automobile
Company" have a big show window on this street,
and in this window they have three or four giant
automobiles. They are all marked "Sold," but they
can't be delivered until after the war.
</p>

<p>
Friedrichstrasse is a very narrow street, and it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198'>198</a></span>
is always so crowded that one can hardly get along
it. Many people walk in the middle of the street.
It is full of little shops and lottery places run by the
government. They have a great many Red Cross
Lotteries, and the chances sell for three marks a
chance. Last winter the winner of the first prize
of many thousand marks never came to claim it.
The number was advertised in all the papers. If the
winner did not turn up in a certain time the money
was to be turned over to the Red Cross.

<p>
On Friedrichstrasse there are several American
shoe stores&mdash;the "Walk Over," the "Hanan," and
the "Vera" shoe. But it is now over two years since
they have had any shoes from America, and they
have filled up their empty boxes with German shoes
which are very inferior to our makes. Busses run
along this street, and many of the conductors are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199'>199</a></span>
women who wear trousers&mdash;not bloomers but regular
men's trousers.

</p>
</div>

<p>
Leipzigerstrasse is all big stores, and these stores
do a rushing business. At one end of the street is
Wertheim's large department store. From the outside
it looks like a public library or a government
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200'>200</a></span>
building, but inside it is rather cheap looking and
it is a regular mirror maze to find your way in.
I doubt if even Mr. Wertheim himself finds his way
through it.
</p>

<p>
Right by the door of this store they have field
post boxes for soldiers all ready packed for sending
things to the front, with goose breast, cakes, candy,
wine, oranges and cigarettes. Everything tied up
with a ribbon of <i><span lang="de_DE">Schwarz-Weiss-Rot</span></i>, and a bit of
green laid on the top. What don't they have in
this store for soldiers! Clothes, caps, blankets,
pocket lamps, knee warmers, pulse warmers, sleeping-bags,
folding knives and forks, and books.
</p>

<p>
The fourth side of the square is Wilhelmstrasse,
and when you read in the papers, "Wilhelmstrasse
says this to-day," or "Wilhelmstrasse is silent," this
is the street. It is a bare street without street-cars
or trees, and lined with gray government buildings.
The German Foreign Office is here, and right beside
it the Chancellor's house, where Bismarck lived so
long. The American Embassy is on the other side
of the street. The Spanish Embassy occupies the
building now. So many automobiles run over this
street that it looks like glass, and when the lamps
are lighted, its reflections are so bright that it looks
as though it had been raining.
</p>

<p>
At the head of Wilhelmstrasse where it meets
Unter den Linden is the famous Brandenburger
Tor, and there, on the top of it, you see the famous
bronze horses that Napoleon took to Paris and that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201'>201</a></span>
were brought back in 1871. When you walk through
its arches you are in the Tiergarten, the great park
of Berlin. This park is always full of people, and
many of them are going out to drive nails into the
Iron Hindenburg. For over two years this nailing
has been going on and the statue is not nearly finished.
It is an enormous figure over fifty feet high.
The money for the nailing goes to the Red Cross.
It costs one mark to drive an iron nail into the figure,
five marks to drive a silver nail, and 100 marks
to drive a gold one. Already the whole top of
Hindenburg's sword is gold, and his wedding ring
is gold. The buttons on his coat are silver. The
nailing is directed by soldiers, and every afternoon
a military band plays in front of the figure.

<i>New Underground and Elevated Railway Terminal in Berlin.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
If you are too lazy to walk around Berlin, you
can ride around on the city elevated, taking the train
at the Potsdam Station. At this station you can
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202'>202</a></span>
nearly always see prisoners&mdash;Arabs, Englishmen,
French&mdash;waiting to be taken out to Zossen, the
great prison camp near Berlin. This station is surrounded
by coal yards, and last winter when it was
so hard to get any coal delivered, I often felt like
getting out here and stealing a lump.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>

<p>
At no time in the day can you ride around the loop
without seeing a troop train. There is always a
troop train flying by. Very gay trains with shouting
soldiers hanging out of the windows and doors.
All waving and crying <i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>! That
means "Till we meet again," but many of them
never come back.
</p>

<p>
Beside the soldier trains are the freight trains and
the funny things they haul: Parts of aeroplanes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203'>203</a></span>
with the wings marked with the Iron Cross; parts
of undersea-boats; sleds for the winters in Russia&mdash;the
kind you see pictures of in story books, and then
cannons, automobiles, little field-kitchen wagons&mdash;everything
painted gray&mdash;"field-gray."
</p>

<p>
Near the Charlottenburg Station is a <i>Mittelstandsküche</i>
or a middle-class kitchen. These kitchens
have been established all over Berlin since the
war, and here one can get a good meal for eighty
pfennigs.
</p>

<p>
If you get off the elevated at the Lehrte Station
you are in Alt-Moabit. Near the station is the great
civil prison of Berlin. It is built like a star with
five arms running out from a center. It makes one
think of an octopus. Here the spies, the offending
editors and the troublesome socialists are imprisoned.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204'>204</a></span>
Liebknecht is here. I knew the prison pastor,
a young man named Dr. Klatt. Dr. Klatt wanted
to go to the front, but he is so useful here that they
will not let him go. He is the go-between for the
prisoners and the outside world. Some of the prisoners
begged to be allowed to go to fight for their
country, and Dr. Klatt helped these men to get free.
He says there is a tremendous amount of patriotism
among the prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Near the prison is a great red barracks. It is
so long that one can scarcely see from one end to
the other. There are always soldiers at the windows,
and if you look their way at all, they are very
apt to call <i>Guten Tag</i>. At the far end of the building
there is a path-way, and no matter at what time
of the day you go there you can see hundreds of new
recruits coming out. They have not received their
uniforms as yet, and they have on old clothes, and
most of them carry boxes in their hands. Two hundred
of them come at a time, six abreast, and when
they have reached the gateway as far back as you
can see, a second batch appears. This lasts as long
as you stand there.
</p>

<p>
A little farther up from the Lehrte Station is the
greatest hospital in Berlin, and it is now used as a
collecting-place for soldiers who have been wounded
and are now well and ready to go back to the front.
Here they go through their final examination to
make sure that they are able to go back.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205'>205</a></span>
you can easily see why the Hohenzollerns have
chosen this as a place to live. It is so cunning, so
little. The tiny houses are of a yellow color. It is
a soldier town. Every man is a soldier, and soldiers
practise all day long in front of the Town Palace
of Frederick the Great. In the street in front of
the palace is a tree, the "Petition-Linden," where
people used to come to present their woes to old
Fritz. On the other side of the palace is the statue
of General Steuben, a replica of which was sent over
as a gift from the Germans to America.
</p>

<p>
Potsdam is most beautiful at sunset. One can
stand on the old bridge and look out over the water.
When the shadows begin to fall, the old knights
on the bridge seem to move and to climb down from
their places. Hark! One can hear the click of their
spurs, the rattle of armor. One by one they leave
the bridge and move toward the old palace in the
darkness.

<h2>
A TRIP DOWN THE HARBOR OF HAMBURG.
</h2>

<p>
My most unique experience in Germany was
my trip down the Harbor of Hamburg, for
strangers are absolutely forbidden near the docks,
and foreigners poking around are arrested. My
trip was made just by chance.
</p>

<p>
An American girl and I took a trip up to Hamburg
Christmas week last year. I was offered letters
of introduction to people there, but I said we
didn't want them, that we were going only for fun,
and we didn't want to be bothered by meeting
strange people. I had been in Hamburg once several
years before, but neither of us knew much
about the place.
</p>

<p>
The first evening, or rather afternoon&mdash;it was
dark at four o'clock&mdash;that we were there, we started
out for a walk. We went through St. Pauli, the
famous sailor quarter, where in times of peace the
sailors spent their time when their ships were in
port. As this was Christmas week, the shooting
galleries and side-shows were open, but the places
were not crowded, as it was too early. Only a few
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208'>208</a></span>
soldiers, sailors and children were walking about
the place.
</p>

<p>
One place had a figure of a soldier in the window.
He was stepping into a room where a woman was
holding a little baby in her arms. On a card was
printed what the soldier was saying, "Excuse me,
young man, but I would like to make your acquaintance.
I am your dad."
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><i>Sailors Learning to Do a Washing in the Seamen's School at
Hamburg.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
We branched off the main street of St. Pauli and
went up a side street. It was pitch dark, and the
streets were not well lighted. At the end of this
street we came to some steps at the bottom of which
was a foot-bridge that led to the water's edge. In
the distance on the other side of the water was
what looked like a great city of lights. We both
held our breath when we saw this place&mdash;it looked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209'>209</a></span>
like New York when you cross on the ferry. And
ferry-boats were shooting all over the water. Great
iron beams with regular rows of lights on their sides
made them look like sky scrapers.
</p>

<p>
"It's New York! It's home!" cried my excited
companion.
</p>

<p>
Great crowds of workmen&mdash;hundreds, thousands
of them&mdash;were coming up the foot-bridge. They
had come over on the ferry. I had my geography
all mixed up and I said, "That is Altona over there.
Let's go down and take a ride on the ferry and pretend
that we are landing in New York."
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p209i.jpg" width="375" height="244" alt="" /><p class="caption">
<i>The Sailors' School for the Merchant Marine.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
We hurried down the narrow foot-bridge. The
men that were hurrying up bumped into us. At the
foot of the bridge was a ticket place. An elderly
man in a blue uniform was standing beside it. We
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210'>210</a></span>
rushed over to him and asked, "Are we allowed to
go over to Altona on the ferry."
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p210i.jpg" width="451" height="351" alt="" />
<p class="caption">
<i>Vegetable Market.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
He looked at us and then laughed and answered
us in English: "That is not Altona. That is the
great Hamburg docks. Where do you want to go?"
</p>

<p>
We told him that we did not know where we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211'>211</a></span>
wanted to go, but that it looked so much like New
York that we wanted to ride over.
</p>

<p>
It was a bitter cold winter night between Christmas
and New Year's, and if he thought that we
were either crazy or spies he never let on.
</p>

<p>
"Have you passports?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
We showed our papers, and he told us that if we
promised to stay on the boat and to come back to
him he would let us go. We promised, and he wrote
our names, our Hamburg, Berlin and American addresses,
our age and religion in a book, and he told
us to buy a ticket.
</p>

<p>
The round trip cost five pfennigs, and the old man
escorted us to the ferry and talked to us until the
boat was ready to start. He said that night and
day 15,000 men were employed on the docks, and
that besides all the men coming over on the boats
many more came over through a tunnel that ran
under the water. He said that they were building
many boats, and that the "Bismarck" would be the
largest boat afloat&mdash;55,000 tons&mdash;and that the "Tirpitz"
would be 32,000 tons, and that so far during
the war there had been made a total tonnage of new
boats of 740,000 tons and that 100,000 tons were
under construction. Then he told us about the
school for sailor boys at Finkenwerder where boys
were being trained as sailors, not for war but for
the merchant marine after the war. I said that I
thought this was certainly very enterprising.
</p>

<i>Goulash Cannon Factory.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
I did not realize what a wild night it was until
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' name='Page_213'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212'>212</a></span>
our boat got started. The ferry tipped up and
down, and the wind was like a knife. Boats were
scooting all over the harbor, and we had a time to
keep from bumping into things.
</p>

<p>
A boy of about twelve years was attending to the
landings. He was a tough little kid, and he smoked
one cigarette after another. And how he could
swear! We wanted to ask him some questions, but
neither of us had the courage. But finally he came
over to us and almost blowing a puff of smoke into
my face he said: "He is an old cab-driver and a
<i>Schreihals</i>, and I hate him." He pointed to the
pilot.
</p>

<p>
When our boat came to the second landing it slid
under the end of a great black thing that hung over
us. "That is the 'Imperator,'" said our sailor boy.
It had been raised up out of the water to keep it
from rotting, and this made it look bigger than
ever. Some of its port holes showed lights. Just
back of the "Imperator" the boy pointed out the
"Bismarck." What a monster it was! It was all
lighted up with electric lights. We could see workmen
moving around on it, and we could hear the
click of their hammers. The "Tirpitz" could hardly
be seen. It lay beyond the "Bismarck" and the
pelting snow blinded our view.
</p>

<p>
We passed all sorts of boats, cruisers, torpedo
boats, supply boats, and steamers. I have never
seen such a busy place as that harbor.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p214i.jpg" width="589" height="354" alt="" /><p class="caption">
<i>The Crowds in the Hamburg Exchange.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
"You are foreigners," said the boy, "and the old
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214'>214</a></span>
boss on the docks doesn't allow foreigners out here.
But I suppose he saw that you were girls and you
wouldn't know much. We have got to be careful
of spies. We have arrested twenty already. The
last one I spotted myself. He was drawing a plan
on a paper. I can tell you nothing gets by me. I
can see you two are harmless."
</p>

<p>
We made a circle around the harbor. When we
came near the cruisers, coming back, one of the
biggest ones broke loose from the group and began
to move slowly away.
</p>

<p>
"Do you see that?" said the boy, "she is going
out again. She has been here for three weeks. She
has been in many a fight. I can tell you she is a
devil." The boat had but a few lights showing, and
in a minute she was lost in the darkness.
</p>

<p>
On our ferry coming back were several hundred
workmen. They were not cripples but big strong
men. When we got off the dock at St. Pauli they
all jumped off and ran. We ran too, for we were
nearly frozen stiff. The old man in blue was waiting
for us, and with chattering teeth we thanked
him and told him how much we had enjoyed our
trip.
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't you like to come in and get warmed
up a bit?" he asked and he took us into a little office
where a great fire was burning. He talked to us
about America. I think he must have been a mate
on a steamer.

It was just six o'clock when we ran up the foot-bridge.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216'>216</a></span>
A boat-load of workmen ran up with us.
At the top we stood a minute and looked out over
the harbor. A sea of lights! A bay of boats! More
workmen! The old man in blue had said: "We are
getting ready for the Hamburg of to-morrow."

<h2>
THE KRUPP WORKS AT ESSEN.
</h2>

<p>
Standing in the main square before the town
hall of Essen is a large bronze monument,
representing not a king, nor yet a hero, but a man
clad in a simple citizen's coat. His right hand rests
on an anvil, and his penetrating eyes are overhung
by a thinker's brow. The granite pedestal bears
the name of "Alfred Krupp."
</p>

<p>
Long ago England knew the process of making
cast steel, but she carefully kept it a secret. In 1800
Friedrich Krupp, the father of Alfred, began to
experiment. He worked early and late. His friends
told him that he was wasting his time, but Friedrich
worked on. After eleven years he discovered the
precious secret, and in 1818, on the present site of
the Essen works, he built eight furnaces, each with
one crucible. He employed only two laborers. And
that was the beginning of the great Krupp works
at Essen.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<i>Bertha Krupp, Her Husband and Children.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
His son Alfred was born in 1812, just one year
after the great discovery was made, and in 1842
Alfred assumed entire charge of the works. His
father had been able to cast steel only in small
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219'>219</a></span>
masses. In 1855 Alfred Krupp sent a block of
steel weighing 4500 pounds to the London Exhibition,
and he was able to cast steel in one mass weighing
more than 100,000 pounds. Alfred Krupp died
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220'>220</a></span>
in 1887, and it was under him that the Krupp works
grew, to such enormous proportions.

<p>
Alfred Friedrich Krupp, the third in line, was
born in 1854 and died in 1902. He was known as
the cannon king. When he died nearly all his
wealth went to his daughter Bertha. In 1906, at
the age of twenty years, Bertha Krupp was married
to a plain German gentleman with only a "von" to
his name, Herr von Bohlen and Halbach. They
have four children living and one child dead, and
they live very quietly at "Villa Hügel" in Essen,
a lovely villa built on the hills above the town. In
1900, before his marriage, Herr von Bohlen was an
attaché at the German embassy at Washington.
Bertha Krupp is the second richest person in the
German empire, running the Kaiser a close second,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221'>221</a></span>
and when this war is over her wealth may surpass
his.

<p>
Essen lies twenty-two miles north of Düsseldorf
on the main railway to Berlin. This is a very thickly
populated district, and the center of a network of
railways which makes it accessible to the Westphalia
coal fields. It is a gloomy-looking town of gray
slate roofs, only brightened by emerald green shutters.
The whole town depends on the Krupp plant
for their livelihood, except the store-keepers and a
few hundred men who manufacture woolen goods,
cigars and dyes.
</p>

<p>
The present Krupp works cover over 150 acres,
and the daily output in time of peace is 1977 tons,
and many times greater in time of war. In 1907
they employed 64,354 workmen, and each year this
number had increased. They make all kinds of guns
of all calibers&mdash;guns for naval and coast defenses,
siege guns, fortress guns, field guns, armor shields
and disappearing carriages for hoisting and transporting
machinery for ammunition. They produce
crucible, Martin, puddled and Bessemer steel, and
also steel castings. They make ammunition with
fuses and bursting charges, armor piercing shells,
explosive steel shells, torpedo shells, cast iron shells,
shrapnel, case shot and fuse setters. Besides these
warlike productions they make railway material,
engineering material, and sheet iron for motor cars.

<i>400 Damaged French and English Cannon Being Repaired at the Krupp Factory.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Plans have been made to erect a gigantic branch
of the Krupp works at Munich. These works will
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223'>223</a></span>
cover one hundred acres, and the city of Munich
recognizing this opportunity for further developments,
has provided enough ground for private industries
that are bound to follow Krupp.
</p>

<p>
The house of Krupp has worked out an elaborate
scheme for the benefit of their workingmen. It is
not a charity scheme, but a building scheme for
both workmen and employer. The scheme was carried
out by Alfred Friedrich Krupp. He built 5469
dwellings, well lighted houses, with as much space
between them as possible and each with a little garden.
All the houses have good water. Three thousand
of the houses were built within fifteen minutes'
walk from the works. The men longest in the firm's
employ and with the largest families were given the
selection of the houses.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225'>225</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Policemen and teachers are eligible to become
tenants of the dwellings. The leases are very binding
and forbid the carrying on of business in the
houses, sub-letting, quarreling with the neighbors,
disorderly noises, the building of additions, misuse
of the drains, the keeping of animals that are disturbing
to the neighbors, smoking stove-pipes without
covers and the lighting of the fire with oil.
</p>

</div>

<p>
The tenant on the first floor must clean the pavement
every day before nine A. M., except Sundays
and holidays when it must be done on the preceding
day between three and four P. M. The rent of the
houses runs from $15 a year for two rooms, to $85
for five or six rooms with a cellar.
</p>

<p>
The Essener Hof is a hotel run by the Krupps,
and it is intended for the guests of the Krupps who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226'>226</a></span>
are doing business with the firm. Then there is a
boarding-house for bachelors and widowers. This
boarding-house was started in 1855 with two hundred
men and now it has over a thousand.
</p>

<p>
For the community of workers there are many stores,
twenty-five grocery stores, two slaughter-houses,
a bakery, a flour mill, an ice plant, a brush
factory, two tailors, two shoemakers, a laundry, a
hotel, eleven restaurants, three cafés, nine beerhalls
and two clubhouses.

<p>
There is a whole staff of doctors to look after the
workmen and their families, and the strict medical
treatment prevents contagious diseases. The laws
of the German empire require certain classes of
workmen to be insured against old age and broken-down
constitutions. This came through the efforts
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227'>227</a></span>
of Bismarck, and it applies to all workmen with a
salary not exceeding $500 a year. Alfred Krupp
gave $250,000 to the workmen, the interest of which
is used as a fund to encourage them to build their
own houses and as a help for the needy. It is loaned
to the workmen at a very small rate of interest.
</p>

<p>
Besides these benefits he established private
schools the purpose of which is to qualify the children
of the workmen to earn honest profitable livings.
A fee of five cents a month is charged to each
pupil, but if the child remains fifteen months,
seventy-five cents is placed in the savings bank to
his credit.
</p>

<p>
Krupp realized that a contented body of workmen
brings about better results than unhappy ones,
and he felt that his scheme was not only a philanthropic
one but also a good business investment.
</p>

<p>
In the war of 1870 Krupp guns were used, and in
this present war they have played a star role. The
Kaiser sent his personal thanks to the house of
Krupp for all that they have done for Germany.
Frau Bertha is very proud of her works and also
of the nickname of her howitzers: "Busy Berthas."

<h2>
MUNICH IN WAR TIME.
</h2>

<p>
No matter what you want to do in Germany if
you are a foreigner, even a neutral, you have
to go to the police. If you want to take a trip, the
first thing that you do is to go to the police and ask
them if you are allowed to go where you want to
go, and then if you are allowed to go you must return
to the police exactly twenty-four hours before
you start and get your passport stamped.
</p>

<p>
Then you take your bread card, your butter card,
your meat card and your potato card to the bread
commission. They cut off tickets for as long as
you are to be away, and in return they give you a
traveling bread card, a little book with twenty tickets
in it. Each ticket is good for either a roll or a piece
of black bread, and for each week you receive forty
tickets. In the hotels where you stop you receive
a meat card on the days when meat is served.

As soon as you arrive at your destination you
must go to the police and register. Here they write
your whole history down on a field-gray card. One
would think that it was an easy matter to slip away
and the police would never know. This can be done
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229'>229</a></span>
very easily, but if you are caught you get in an
awful muddle. Police come through the trains unexpectedly
and ask to see your passport. If it is
not in order you are liable to be imprisoned, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230'>230</a></span>
you must pay a fine for every day that you are not
registered. Sensible people follow all the police
rules. They are well advertised and one cannot fail
to know them.

An American lady I know went from Berlin to
Munich without registering at the police station. A
man came through the train and asked her for her
pass, and when he saw that it was not stamped she
was ordered to report to the Munich police at once.
When she got to Munich she forgot to go to the
police for three days, and when she went there the
good-natured Bavarian policeman let her off.
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad," she said, "I would not know what
to wear if I went to jail.'"
</p>

<p>
It was in September, 1916, that I made my last
trip to Munich. One seldom sees French prisoners
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231'>231</a></span>
in Berlin, but all the way from Berlin to Munich
I saw them working in the fields. All of these prisoners
had on blue coats and their famous bright red
trousers. They made gay spots on the dull German
landscapes.
</p>

<p>
Every little farm had geese, and every little town
had its little garrison of soldiers, training. In some
places the soldiers were out in the fields drilling.
They were running, jumping and shooting.
</p>

<p>
The center of attraction of our whole train was
a young sailor from the "Deutschland." He was a
fine young fellow and he smiled at everybody. At
every station he got out and bought something to
eat. He seemed to have an endless appetite and a
very long purse.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233'></a></span>

<p>
As one gets farther and farther into Bavaria, the
wayside shrines begin to appear. They are everywhere
along the roads and in the fields. At different
places harvest workers could be seen gathered
around the shrines in prayer.
</p>

<p>
When one is many, many miles away from Munich,
one can see the two towers of the <i>Frauenkirche</i>,
red towers with green tops. These towers
are the symbol of Munich.
</p>

<p>
Outwardly, the only change that one can see in
Munich is the substituting of soldiers for students,
and it really spoils the place, for while the military
spirit suits Berlin so well, it seems out of place with
these more gentle southern people. The Bavarian
uniforms are trimmed around the collar with a blue
and white braid that looks like the edging on a
child's petticoat. It is hard to understand how such
artistic people could choose such a thing, but a Bavarian's
artistic sense is in his mind and not in his
dress. The Bavarian soldiers have a reputation all
over Germany for being very fine warriors.
</p>

<p>
The loss of the old Prince Regent Luitpold meant
much to these people, and his son can never hope to
be as popular even if he did have to wait seventy
years before he came to the throne. The Crown
Prince Rupert is more popular than his father. He
is nearly always with his troops at the front, and
even when his eldest boy died, he felt that he could
not get away. He said, "This is no time for a
soldier not to be attending to his duty." His next
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234'>234</a></span>
son, Prince Albert, is now the heir to the throne.
He is a beautiful little boy and is tremendously popular
in Munich. The old Müncheners say that he
is very much like what Ludwig II was when he
was a boy.

<p>
Most things to eat are much more plentiful in
Munich than in Berlin. For instance, a man can
have a pint of milk every day and a woman can have
more than that. Ham costs only seventy cents a
pound without a card, and on meat days it can be
bought in any of the restaurants. The meat portions
in the Munich restaurants are one hundred and
eighty grams while in Berlin they range from fifty
to forty grams; and in Bavaria the price for the
portion is no higher.
</p>

<p>
Vegetables and fruit are very plentiful, but butter
and eggs are scarcer than in Berlin. One person
gets only fifty grams of butter each week and one
egg. In Berlin we generally got eighty grams of
butter and never less than an egg and a half a week.
</p>

<p>
In Bavaria everything is divided among the people.
For instance, if a man who lives in the country near
Munich has a load of hay for sale, he brings that
load of hay to Munich to what they call the central
station. They have all kinds of central stations in
Munich, for grain, for meat, for eggs, for vegetables,
and for butter. The load of hay which the
man brings is divided up and given out where it is
most needed; he does not dare to sell the load of hay
himself.

<p>
It is just the same with eggs. Suppose that you
had a brother in the country, and he wanted to send
you one hundred eggs to pack for the winter. He
could not send you the eggs direct. He would have
to send them first to the central station, and if eggs
were plentiful that week, the central station would
let you have the eggs; but if eggs were scarce and
were needed elsewhere, you are given only a small
part of the eggs. This plan is followed in everything.
Even if you raise a pig, you cannot keep all
the meat yourself, you must sell a part of it to your
neighbor if he needs it.
</p>

<p>
The rolls in Munich are much better than in Berlin,
and they seem to be made of entirely white flour.
Cheese is very scarce in Berlin, but in Munich there
is plenty of cheese, and it is very cheap. Pure coffee
can be bought at a dollar a pound without a card,
and although there is a sugar card the same as in
Berlin, still all the restaurants and cafés serve pure
sugar.
</p>

<p>
The price of beer has not been affected much by
the war and beer that was twenty-eight pfennigs
before the war is now thirty-four pfennigs, and the
Hofbräu beer, or the beer made by the royal brewery,
is thirty-two pfennigs. Fine malt beers such
as Bock Beer and Märzen Beer are prohibited from
being made, as they take too much malt and saccharine.

One evening when I was there we walked through
the Mathazerbräu, the greatest beer hall in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238'>238</a></span>
world. The place was one mass of people drinking
beer, soldiers and officers and women. Most of the
guests brought their supper with them, and everybody
was smoking. It was like walking through a
thick fog, there was so much smoke.

<p>
We went to a lot of theaters, cafés and cabarets,
and they were always full. Everywhere we went
we had trouble in getting a seat. Everybody seemed
to be having a very nice time. They were not hilarious,
but they seemed to think that staying at home
and moping would not help matters. The most
astonishing part was the vast amount of money
spent everywhere. Some cabarets only served champagne,
and the spenders ordered it by the quart.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240'>240</a></span>
No one got drunk in spite of the amount of fluid they
poured into them.
</p>

<p>
The art show at the Glass Palace was on when
I was there, but I did not find it as interesting as the
great show I had seen there the year before the war.
There were too many landscapes of a dull color.
This did not interfere with the sale of the pictures,
and one-tenth of them were marked sold.

<i>The Home of Franz von Stuck in Munich.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
One day I paid a visit to the studio of Herr Franz
von Stuck. He was very cordial. He is a splendid,
big, strong man. Lately he has built an addition
to his house so that he can have more room for his
work, and he has one of the finest studios I have
ever seen. The first floor is for modeling, and the
second floor is for painting. He said that it was
very hard to get good models now as all the men
of fine physique were in the war.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241'>241</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Do you get the same amount of bread as an
ordinary man?" I asked him.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly the same," he answered. "The poorest
workingman in the streets gets the same as I.
That is why our system is so splendid."
</p>

<p>
He hardly mentioned his work at all, indeed he
seemed quite shy about it. On his table was a dish
made of Brazilian butterflies. He picked it up and
turned it so that it showed blue, then brown, and
then green. "Isn't it beautiful!" he said enthusiastically,
"Look at it now!"
</p>

<p>
I looked around the room at all his wonderful
pictures. I thought of all the fame that was his
and of all the honors that had been heaped at his
feet, and yet there he was admiring a butterfly's
wing. I had the feeling that a great man stood
before me.

<h2>
FROM BERLIN TO VIENNA IN WAR TIME.
</h2>

<p>
You would naturally think that it would be a
very easy matter to go from Berlin to Vienna
in war time, because Germany and Austria are allies,
and that it would be as easy as traveling around
Germany; that all you would have to do would be
to pack your trunk, go down to the station, buy your
ticket and get on the train. Of course you must
do all these things, but you must do a great many
other things before you do that.
</p>

<p>
The first thing that you do is to go to the police
where you are registered and get what they call a
<i>Fragebogen</i>, which means a question sheet. You
cannot get this sheet unless you have a letter from
some important person or firm stating that it is
necessary for you to go. Your reason must be a
very good one.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/p243i.jpg" width="591" height="353" alt="" />
<p class="caption">
<i>Vienna&mdash;Along the Danube.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
You fill out your <i>Fragebogen</i>, the police look up
your record and if it is found out to be all right,
they put your letter of recommendation, your passport,
the <i>Fragebogen</i> and half a dozen pictures of
yourself in an envelope and seal it. You take this
sealed envelope to the main police station in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243'>243</a></span>
district in which you live. Here the package is
opened by several different men in several different
rooms, and finally, after many questions and much
stamping, you are told to write your name across
your picture which has been pasted on a card.
</p>

<p>
After you are through with the German police,
you must have your pass viséd by the Austro-Hungarian
consul. Here you must go to three different
men and be "stamped" and the last man takes two
more of your pictures and pastes them on a pink
card. Then you pay four marks to another man
who does some more stamping. After all these
things are done, you go back to your local police
and register that you are going away, and then,
after showing your pass at the railway ticket office,
you are allowed to buy your ticket to Vienna. This
was what a neutral American had to do before we
got into the war&mdash;now I doubt if an American could
go to Vienna at all.
</p>

<p>
It is a sixteen hours' ride from Berlin to Vienna
with a one hour's wait at Tetschen on the Austro-German
frontier. Our first stop was at Dresden,
and like all German stations it was full of soldiers.
The ride from Dresden to Tetschen is very beautiful.
It runs through the Saxon Switzerland, a lovely
country with mountains, streams of water and little
villages. How peaceful everything was! How
quiet! It did not seem like a country that was taking
part in a great war.

<p>
At noon we reached Tetschen, a cold, dismal looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245'>245</a></span>
place. First we had our baggage examined by
both Austrian and German officials. These officials
are all clever men. Some of them are dressed up to
look like common soldiers, but they are all fine lawyers
and criminal experts.
</p>

<p>
A soldier stood up on a box and said that any one
who had any writing about him should give it up.
In my stocking I had my money and a letter of introduction
that I had brought from America and
which I was going to use in Vienna. I understood
perfectly well what the soldier said, but for some
unknown reason or other I simply didn't feel like
pulling the letter out of my stocking. This was
madness on my part, for I had learned long ago
that if you follow directions in Germany you don't
get into trouble, and if you don't follow them, you
are sure to get into a mess.
</p>

<p>
After this, we were taken through a gate where
we gave up our passes and they were taken away
to see if the picture corresponded with the one sent
down by the German police. The men here had a
dreadful time with my name. All Germans find my
name a difficult one. One soldier here just insisted
that my name was "Auley" without the "Mc," but
finally another soldier gave him a poke and said
that "Mc" was a title and that I was of royal blood.

<p>
Everybody who didn't have a German or an Austrian
pass had to undress, and as soon as I got into
the searching-room, I gave the woman who was to
search me, the letter out of my stocking. She took it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247'>247</a></span>
and gave it to some one. My heart was in my
mouth, for I had no idea what they would do, and
I knew if they did anything to me it would be my
own fault for not following directions.
</p>

<p>
I got a very good searching, and I had to take
off all my clothes, only when she told me to take off
my shoes and I commenced to unlace one boot she
said never mind that one, to take off the other one.
I had hardly gotten dressed before there was a
knock at the door of the dressing-room and some
one said I was wanted. I put on my hat and went
out, and there planked in front of the door with
both legs spread out and a long sword at his side,
was a good-looking little Saxon officer aged about
twenty years.
</p>

<p>
He had a fierce look on his face as he demanded,
"Why didn't you give this up in the other room?"
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't," I answered, "it was in my stocking.
You couldn't expect me to take it out of my stocking
before all those men, could you?"
</p>

<p>
Then we both laughed and I said, "I hope you
will give it to me again."
</p>

<p>
"Of course I will," he answered.
</p>

<p>
I went with him to the commanding officer, but
that man would not give me back the letter. I didn't
care, I was so glad I hadn't been arrested. When
we came back from Vienna, I was the only one of
our party that had to undress. I never noticed it,
but there was some kind of a mark on my pass, and
as soon as the official saw it I had to undress. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249'>249</a></span>
this time I had nothing in my stocking. When they
searched my trunk they took away from me all the
post cards and photos of Vienna I had, and didn't
give them back.
</p>

<p>
After leaving Tetschen, the train runs for hours
through Bohemia. It does not touch at Prague but
at a number of small picturesque towns such as
Kolin and Znaim. The country is extensively cultivated
and very fertile. The train was supposed to
be an express train but it stopped at every little way-station.
</p>

<p>
At one station, a very beautifully dressed lady
with a little girl got on the train. I thought that
she must be the wife of some high official and I was
surprised at her lovely clothes away out there in
Bohemia. She sat next to me, and in a short time
she began talking to the woman who sat across from
her and who kept asking over and over if any one
in the coupé knew when we got to Deutschbrod.
The beautifully-dressed lady said that she knew for
she was going there. And then she told the whole
coupé about the place.
</p>

<p>
To my surprise she said that she was the wife of
the apothecary at the Barracks at Deutschbrod. The
Barracks is a city built since the war on the hills
above the town. It was built by the Austrian government
and is the home of the refugees of East
Galicia whose homes were destroyed by the Russians.
Most of these <i><span lang="de_DE">Flüchtlinge</span></i>, as the Germans

call them, are Polish and Russian Jews, but they
have also two hundred Italians from near Görz.

<p>
The wife of the apothecary, who was a Hungarian
woman, said that the refugees had everything
they needed and that everything was free&mdash;clothes,
food, wine, beer, doctor's service and medicine. She
said that unless there was some contagious disease
in the camp the people were allowed perfect freedom
to go and come as they pleased. Most of the inmates
have their own gardens and raise their own
chickens.
</p>

<p>
It was dark when we came to the place, but the
apothecary's wife pointed it out on a distant hill.
It was like a great city, one mass of electric lights
sparkling in the darkness. When I came back from
Vienna I had a good look at it. It was a hillside
town made up of new frame houses, mostly small
houses laid out in regular rows separated by straight
streets.
</p>

<p>
After Deutschbrod was passed, our compartment
was empty except for a young Jewish woman who
had been sitting quietly in the corner. After a while
she leaned over to us and said, "You speak English.
I can see it that you are Americans. I was once in
New York." And then she told us that she was a
refugee from East Galicia.

"It was terrible," she said in rather good English.
"I was in America for a whole year. I saw Niagara
Falls. Then shortly before the war broke out my
mother wrote for me to come home. We had such
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253'>253</a></span>
a nice house, and such nice things in our house.
They belonged to my ancestors. On the 4th of
October we heard that the Russians were coming
toward our village and that they were only forty
kilometers away. We had already sent our best
horses to the army. The ones left behind were sent
to the village for the old people. My mother and
father rode, and my husband and I walked or rather
ran after them for two days as fast as we could.
We hadn't time to take anything with us, and we
had to leave even our glassware and silver behind.
I had a new Persian lamb coat that I left hanging
in the cupboard. We have never been able to go
back to our homes since." She wept a little.
</p>

<p>
It was ten o'clock when we came to Vienna. We
had a hard time getting a cab, and when we did get
one it rattled over the stones as though it had no
rubber on its wheels. The first thing we had to do
the next morning was to go to the police, and it
took us the whole morning until two o'clock in the
afternoon to get registered. There were only two
clerks and about fifty people waiting. We came in
turns, and if any one tried to get in ahead of his
turn the rest of us howled, "Wait your turn." One
fat, important-looking foreigner tried to get into the
clerk's room without waiting. Three men waiters
jumped up and turned him out. This pleased the
rest of us and we all giggled with glee.

I had never realized the wonderfulness of the
German food card system until I went to Vienna.
In Germany you can buy at a reasonable price your
allotted ration of food, and the poor people are just
as well off as the rich, but in Vienna the rich people
have everything and the poor people are in great
need because of the lack of food regulations, and
while there is an abundance of food it is so dear that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257'>257</a></span>
the poor cannot afford to buy. And Vienna is not
like Berlin&mdash;there are a great many poor people in
Vienna.

For some time there has been a bread card in
Vienna, and at the time of my visit, November 1916,
the government was just beginning to take the food
question in hand, and a few weeks before Christmas
a coffee and a sugar card were issued. But the
Austrians have not the gift for organization which
the Germans have, and I heard that even six months
later the food distribution was in a very poor state.
I talked to many Austrians, and they all told me that
they were anxious to have the entire German food
card system established in Austria.

<p>
Austria is a great agricultural and wheat-raising
country, and yet when I was there, there was very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259'>259</a></span>
little bread in Vienna. The beautiful white Viennese
bread had entirely disappeared, and a soggy brown
stuff had taken its place. There was one kind called
"Anker Bread" that was still very good, and the
people stood in line to get it. And all this was not
because flour was scarce but because of its poor distribution.
</p>

<p>
None of the restaurants are allowed to serve
bread, even if you have a bread card you cannot get
it, and the only place a stranger can get bread in
Vienna is for breakfast at his hotel. People who eat
in restaurants carry their bread with them, and
generals and all sorts of high officials have little
packages of bread concealed in their pockets which
they slyly pull out at the table.
</p>

<p>
All the white flour is baked into cakes, and the
Viennese cakes are as white and as wonderful as in
their palmiest days. But the price! In a café a
piece of cake of two thin layers costs one crown
twenty-five hellers, about a quarter in our money.

<i>Wholesale Cabbage Market in Vienna.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
In most German cities one person gets about a
pound of meat a week, but in Vienna there is no
meat card and you can buy as much meat as you
like if you can afford to buy it. Every meat shop
in Vienna is hanging full of meat&mdash;sausage, ham,
pork, beef, chickens and geese. I went through the
great Viennese market which is squares and squares
long. Everywhere meat, meat, meat. I had forgotten
that there was so much meat in the world.
Stall after stall just loaded down with hams, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261'>261</a></span>
no bacon. Mostly young pigs. But no one was
buying, only looking&mdash;like Till Eulenspiegel, as
though the smell was enough. The hams were from
one dollar to one dollar and sixty cents a pound, and
the beef was even higher. Sausage was not so expensive,
and geese were cheaper than in Germany.
</p>

<p>
I had never seen such an abundance of everything.
Acres and acres of cabbages piled up as high
as a house&mdash;great, hard-looking heads of a fresh
green color. Then barrels and barrels of apples.
Not such good apples as we have in America, but at
such a fancy price! For thirty-two cents we got
six little dried-up apples that we could hardly eat.
</p>

<p>
From the apple market we went to the onion
market. Can you imagine a square as big as Union
Square in New York where nothing but onions are
sold? Well, they have that in Vienna. And the
most wonderful onions! Small white ones, small
red ones, big yellow ones and green ones! Onion
peelings flew around everywhere, and do you know
that they really smelled sweet? But the old women
in back of the stalls did not look sweet, but as though
they had stood among onions so long that they had
become dried-up onions themselves.

<p>
They had no potatoes in the market, but the restaurants
seemed to have plenty of them. Cheese
was just beginning to be scarce, and one person
could buy only a quarter of a pound at a time. We
collected cheese to take back to Berlin with us, and
we took turns going into the shops and buying a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' name='Page_264'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263'>263</a></span>
piece so that the clerks would not know that we
were together. We collected a good many pounds
and we got them safely over the frontier.
</p>

<p>
Eating in a restaurant in Vienna in war time is
the most expensive thing of which I know. Small
meat or deer orders were from eighty cents upward,
and no potatoes go with this order. In Germany,
you can get a piece of meat, two potatoes and a
vegetable for thirty-two cents.
</p>

<p>
There seems to be plenty of milk and sugar in
Vienna, but it is forbidden for any café to serve
milk in coffee between the hours of two and seven
o'clock, when every Viennese goes to a café to drink
coffee. This restriction saves many gallons of milk.
The coffee is real coffee and very good. You can
have as many eggs as you like, very nicely cooked
at fifteen cents an egg. Sugar is not served on the
trains between Berlin and Vienna, but in a café
they give you three lumps with a cup of coffee. Saccharine
is served with tea.

The war has been very hard on the Austrians,
and distress shows itself in the faces of the people
you meet on the streets. They do not come of the
sturdy stock that the Germans come from. They
have always been a very religious people, and the
war has made them more religious than ever, and
now they are always burning candles before their
favorite altar or saint's picture. The sacred picture
in the Church of St. Stephen is always lighted by
dozens of candles, and there is never a moment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265'>265</a></span>
when the church is opened that some one is not
kneeling before this picture, children, soldiers and
old women with their empty market baskets. For
the Catholic Viennese this picture is the center of
everything, and in the war this inanimate object has
played a big part. They pray to it to help the men
in battle, to care for the wounded and to bless the
souls of the dead. Centuries ago this picture was
stolen by the Turks or some other kind of Pagan,
and it is said that the eyes of the picture shed real
tears until it was brought back and placed in a
Christian church again. It stands on the ground
on an easel, and people are allowed to touch the wire
over it.
</p>

<p>
Small change is very scarce in Vienna, and they
have torn the two-crown paper bills in two, and
each half is good for a crown. They also use stamps
for change as they do in Germany. Now they are
making crowns and half-crowns of paper.
</p>

<p>
This winter is going to be terrible for the poor
of Vienna, for last winter was bad enough. I really
wonder what the people will do to get along.

<h2>
SOLDIERS OF VIENNA.
</h2>

<p>
I had been in Vienna, and each time I had
thought that the most wonderful and exquisite
things were the Viennese officers. They have always
seemed to me like dainty paper dolls which had
just stepped out of a fashion plate. I had imagined
that in war time they would look less spick and span&mdash;but
no indeed, they looked just the same, real war
having made no difference.
</p>

<p>
The Austrian officer is of only one type. He is
very tall, very slender and very graceful, and he is
mostly rather dark than light. He has a small head
and face, a straight nose, curved lips and a short
but square chin. He may have eyes of any color,
but he is clean shaven&mdash;a mustache is no longer the
fashion. His nails are polished and his manners
are delightful. He is generally well educated and
very clever. But he does not look substantial. He
seems to have no inner power.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">
<i>Franz Josef in Uniform.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
The uniform of the Austrian army from the commonest
soldiers to the highest official is away ahead
of the German uniforms. The German uniforms
have the tendency to make the men look wide and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_269' name='Page_269'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268'>268</a></span>
squatty, and the ugly little stiff flat caps of the Germans
only emphasize this fact. The Austrian uniform
on the other hand makes the men look tall and
slender. The belt of the coat is high, and this makes
the legs look longer, and the straight cap adds more
to the height.
</p>

<p>
Most of the officers' coats are of field-gray color,
but not all as in Germany. The artillery men, for
instance, wear a coat of dark reddish brown that
is very stunning in color. The Hussars wear a
short gray coat of very heavy cloth and black trousers.
Around their neck they wear a fur collar and
over the fur a heavy gold braid is tied. Other
officers wear white broadcloth uniforms, and although
Vienna is by no means a clean city these
white suits are always spotless. Most of the officers
wear white kid gloves and their boots shine like a
mirror. The streets of Vienna are full of these
officers. One wonders who is at the front.
</p>

<p>
Nearly all the Austrian officers and many of the
Viennese policemen wear corsets, and you can see
the corsets displayed in the men's furnishings windows.
They are not as long as a woman's corset
and are generally made of fancy silk, yellow and
black&mdash;the Austrian colors&mdash;preferred. All the officers
wear such long swords that they drag on the
ground.
</p>

<p>
They do not have shoulder straps to denote rank
as they have in Germany, but stars on the collar are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_270' name='Page_270'>270</a></span>
used instead. A single star made out of any kind
of cloth denotes a common soldier; two stars an
<i>Unteroffizier</i>, or a corporal; three stars a <i>Feldwebel</i>,
or a sergeant; a silver star means a <i>Leutnant</i>, or a
lieutenant; two silver stars an <i>Oberleutnant</i>, or a
first lieutenant; three silver stars means a <i>Hauptmann</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_271' name='Page_271'>271</a></span>
or a captain; one gold star means a <i>Major</i>,
and so on up the list.
</p>

<p>
All the uniforms are very practical and very well
made. The overcoats of the common soldiers are
lined all the way down, and the gray caps are not
stiff but are made out of a soft cloth. The legs are
bound in strips of heavy cloth which wind round
and round.
</p>

<p>
All the common soldiers have their hats stuck
full of fancy pins of all kinds, and the soldiers from
Tyrol have <i>Edelweiss</i> pins stuck in their hats, for
that is the flower of the mountains. The Viennese
Red Cross girls also wear many pins. They wear
a gray suit and a hat that is trimmed with bright
red and is very becoming.
</p>

<p>
If Vienna is full of officers the country around is
full of common soldiers. I saw them from the train
windows. Some of them were farming, others were
fishing, and still others were walking along the
country roads, perhaps going home on a furlough.

<p>
One day I went to the Central Cemetery in
Vienna where Mozart, Gluck, Beethoven, Schubert,
Johann Strauss and Brahms lie buried in a little
plot of ground. Just before you come to the cemetery
there is a barracks. It had only a barbed wire
fence around it and we could see into the place. It
was made up of small frame houses and looked like
a western mining town that had sprung up in a
single night. Before the door of a house near the
fence a soldier was doing a good-sized washing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272'>272</a></span>
He seemed to be very much worried for fear he
was not getting the things clean. I am sure he was
rubbing everything full of holes. When he saw us
watching him, he first wiped the perspiration from
his brow, then he laughed. "<i><span lang="de_DE">Sehr schwer</span></i>," (very
hard), he said sighing.
</p>

<p>
The Central Cemetery is so large that nearly
every one who dies in Vienna is buried in it. When
a funeral comes in at the gate the bells are tolled,
and the funerals came in one after another the day
I was there. The hearses of the soldiers were draped
with the Austrian flag. People follow the hearse
walking. An old woman dressed in black and with
a black shawl tied over her head was holding on to
the back of one of these soldier hearses. It seemed
as though she could not bear to be parted from her
dead. She was not weeping but had a strange grim
look on her face, a face in which all hope was gone.
</p>

<p>
From the cemetery we went to the Prater to see
the less dismal side of soldier life. The Prater is
the great park of Vienna. It has splendid drives,
but one end is like a Coney Island or a Luna Park.
It is a very gay place even now in war time; there
are merry-go-rounds, roller-coasters and all kinds
of side shows. The crowd was very much mixed,
but most of the men were soldiers, privates, and
they looked like men from the country. I saw one
old Austrian general getting on the loop-the-loop
with a little boy. He was showing his grandson a
good time.

Along the streets one could buy roasted peanuts,
roasted chestnuts, roasted apples, and roasted potatoes.
I bought a potato. It was served to me in a
newspaper, and I had to eat the thing without the
aid of a knife or a fork. It tasted fine to me.
</p>

<p>
One morning we went to the art gallery, but it
was closed. Now it is open only one day a week.
When we came out of the gallery a common soldier
came up and spoke to us. He asked us what there
was to see in Vienna. He said he only had until
six o'clock that night, and he did not know what to
go to see, as he had never been in Vienna before.
</p>

<p>
He was a young man with light hair and very
gentle manners. He was dressed in field gray but
I noticed something queer about him. All German
and Austrian privates wear pieces of gray linen
around their necks instead of collars, but this man
had on a white collar with a black border. Was he
a priest? He asked me a lot of questions as to
whether this church or that church was open or
not and then I said to him, "Are you a priest?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered, "I am the village priest of
the little town of X.... I am a volunteer in this war,
and now after a year I am returning on my first
furlough to my little parish. My people will be very
glad to see me, but in two weeks I must be back to
the front again. An old man is taking my place.
He was too old to go, but I am young and my country
needed me." He walked along with us a little way
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_277' name='Page_277'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' name='Page_276'>276</a></span>
and when he left us, he raised his hands over our
heads and gave us his blessing.

<p>
The guard change in the court of the city palace
in Vienna is a great spectacle. It takes about a
half an hour and is much more elaborate than the
one in Berlin. I can't begin to tell all that takes
place. Soldiers stand in rows, then they come out
and salute, and then they go back again. The officers
must stand without moving, they don't seem
to breathe, and this standing is so strenuous that
three times in that half hour they must be relieved.
When the Austrian flag is brought out all the men
lift their hats and salute it with drawn swords. In
between the military band plays, and when the playing
is over a major comes out and congratulates the
officers on their performance. It is like a piece on
the stage.
</p>

<p>
The opera in Vienna is always crowded with
soldiers, and they make a very gay assembly, officers
with their gay uniforms and Viennese ladies
in their low-necked gowns. The customs in Vienna
are not the same as in America, and a real lady can
take an officer to the theater or to dinner, paying
his way.
</p>

<p>
One night we were seated in a restaurant when
a first lieutenant, a tall fellow dressed in black and
gold, came in with a lady. They sat down at the
table next to us. He was very polite, hanging up
her coat, taking a spot of dirt off her face, and then
he read over the bill of fare and asked her what she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278'>278</a></span>
wanted. They were not married to each other, for
they used <i><span lang="de_DE">Sie</span></i> and not the familiar <i><span lang="de_DE">Du</span></i>. He wanted
her to have either roast duck or roast goose, but
she said no, that they were too expensive, and she
modestly took two "wienies" and some sauerkraut
at sixty cents a plate. "What a considerate lady,"
I thought, "she doesn't want to be too hard on that
poor officer." When the waiter came around I
nearly fell over to see her foot the bill, and then she
gave the officer five crowns to pay for the cab.
</p>

<p>
Another day I was in a shop buying cheese. A
young lady came in with three officers&mdash;two artillery
officers and a hussar. First she bought several
dollars' worth of cakes, and then she bought each
of the men a bottle of fancy liqueur. Her bill was
over thirteen dollars. She carried the cakes and the
bottle for the hussar, because he had on white gloves
and had no pockets. It is a great thing to be a
Viennese officer.

<h2>
WOMEN WARRIORS.
</h2>

<p>
Perhaps in no other war have there been so
many women warriors as in this one. In Russia,
in Galicia, in Hungary, in Serbia, and in Montenegro,
countless women have gone out to fight.
They have served in the trenches, in the mountain
passes and on ships. They have suffered hardships
the same as the men, enduring the cold, the wretched
food and the strenuous work without a murmur.
Each one of the women has had love of country and
fireside in her heart, but in most cases it was love
for her husband from whom she did not wish to
be separated that sent her to the front.
</p>

<p>
The peasant women in these far eastern countries
have always done the work of men. They have tilled
the soil, built houses and made roads, and so it
seems quite natural to them that they should fight.
A number of Russian women soldiers have been
taken prisoners, and it is impossible to tell them
from men.

<p>
The German government does not permit her
women to fight, but every now and then one of them
disguises herself as a man and enlists, fighting for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_280' name='Page_280'>280</a></span>
her country until she is found out. In France, a
few women have done the same thing, and in England
a regiment of "Riflewomen" has been formed,
not for service on the front, but for home defense
if it ever becomes necessary. In Serbia, early in
the war, women formed a battalion known as the
"Death's Head Battalion," and at that time they
were very active. Some women in the Austrian,
Hungarian and Russian armies have been made
corporals and sergeants, and many of them have received
decorations for valor.
</p>

<p>
The most famous woman warrior of the present
war has been the Grand Duchess Augusta of Austria,
wife of the Grand Duke Josef. Ever since
Italy entered the war she has been at the head of
her regiment on the Italian front. She dresses like
a soldier, wears a helmet on her head, carries a
sword and rides her horse like a man. The Grand
Duke is very proud of her and does everything he
can to encourage her activities.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth Lorenz, also a Viennese, is the second
famous woman warrior. She is the wife of the
famous surgeon Dr. Adolf Lorenz, and she went
to the front as her husband's assistant, driving a
Red Cross wagon to and from the firing line. She
was decorated by Franz Josef before he died.
</p>

<p>
Another Austrian to serve her country was a little
twelve-year-old peasant girl, Rosa Zenoch, who,
during the fighting at Rawaruska, carried water to
the soldiers in the trenches. In the thick of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' name='Page_281'>281</a></span>
fray she stopped to give a drink to a wounded
Hungarian soldier lying by the wayside. Some
shrapnel burst around her and she was severely
wounded. She was carried to the hospital train,
but on the way to Vienna it was necessary to amputate
her leg. When Franz Josef heard about her
case he sent her a golden band set with diamonds,
10,000 crowns and a new leg.
</p>

<p>
In one Hungarian regiment the eighteen-year-old
Anna Falacia served five months without any one
knowing that she was a girl. Since Anna's mother
died she and her twin brother had been inseparable,
and when he was called to the colors, she dressed
herself as a boy and went with him. During the
storming of Belgrade the brother of Anna Falacia
was shot and he fell dying at her feet. When she
saw him lying there she burst into tears. They carried
him away and she left her post and followed
the bier. The sergeant called her back. "I am Anna
Falacia," she cried, "I am a girl, and now that my
brother is dead, I am going back."
</p>

<p>
A German woman who disguised herself as a
man was Maria Balka. When the Russians invaded
Memel in East Prussia they killed Max Balka.
When his wife Maria saw what they had done, she
swore that she would have revenge. She dressed
as a man and enlisted. No one knew her. She was
a good soldier and she rose from private to corporal
and then to sergeant. She even won a band for
being one of the five best shots in her regiment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282'>282</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At Kowno, twenty thousand Russians were taken
prisoners, and Maria Balka with two underofficers
and ten men were ordered to take one thousand of
them to Gumbinnen. There were no trains, and
they had to march. The orders were strict&mdash;if a
prisoner got out of line he was to be shot. It was
no time for mercy.
</p>

<p>
In the village of Pilwiski they passed a hut. A
Russian peasant woman was standing in the doorway.
She had a baby in her arms. When she saw
the men she rushed forward crying, "Peter! Peter
Doroff!" A prisoner broke from the ranks and
rushed into her arms, although he knew the order
was death. Four German privates stopped and leveled
their guns and waited the order from Maria
Balka to fire. Maria Balka's face was all aflame;
she would make at least one Russian suffer as she
had suffered. It was her moment. But the Russian
woman flung herself at Maria's feet.
</p>

<p>
"That is my husband," she pleaded, "Don't shoot
him. He is all I have."
</p>

<p>
Maria's hand which had been raised to give the
signal trembled and then fell at her side.
</p>

<p>
"March," she said to the surprised soldiers.
</p>

<p>
"You may keep him," she said to the terrified
woman. When Maria reported at headquarters she
explained what she had done, and she told them that
she was a woman. The next day she went back to
Memel. Her desire for revenge was dead.
</p>

<p>
One German woman, Anne Marie Reimer, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283'>283</a></span>
wife of a doctor in East Prussia, served seven
months as the driver of an automobile truck, and
the result of her experiences is a very interesting
book <i>Seven Months on the East Front as a Driver</i>.
In this book, she tells how she guided her automobile
right up to the firing line. Once, when the fighting
was very fierce she did not have her clothes off for
four weeks. When the Kaiser came to review her
regiment, she passed in review in front of him with
the rest of the men. In February, 1915, she was
taken with fever contracted by the exposure. Her
husband brought her to Berlin. In her book she
says that no one knows the unselfishness and the
kindness of soldiers toward each other, and she
thinks that war has an ennobling influence on the
men.
</p>

<p>
The Russian prisoners in the German prison camp
at Zossen went in a body to the German major and
asked him to have a Russian prisoner, Nicholas
Nisoff, removed from their barracks. He was possessed
with the devil, they said, and he was trying
to cast a spell over them. The major sent for
Nicholas Nisoff, and he came pale and trembling.
</p>

<p>
"Nicholas Nisoff," said the major, "sit down and
tell me what is the matter. What have you done
that you are silent all day and cry out all night?"
</p>

<p>
It was below freezing in the major's barnlike
office, but Nicholas had to wipe the perspiration
from his brow as he staggered into a seat. He began
in broken sentences.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' name='Page_284'>284</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"It happened in Galicia. In the morning we took
two hundred Austrian and Hungarian prisoners.
We shut them up in different places, and in one hut
where thirty of them were, I was detailed on night
watch. All night long I paced up and down before
the cottage. It was very quiet, but at last I heard
a noise. The window was slowly opened and some
one jumped to the ground. "Halt!" I cried, "Halt!
Or I will fire." The person did not stop, so I fired
into the darkness. I took out my pocket lamp to
see what kind of a Hungarian I had shot, and there
on the ground a slender figure was lying. I looked
again. I could not believe what I saw. It was a
woman! Her cap had fallen off and her long yellow
hair was streaming about her. I felt her heart. It
had stopped beating. And I, Nicholas Nisoff, had
killed a woman. And since that time I cannot sleep,
and in the night she comes to me with her long hair
streaming around, and pointing her finger at me she
says, 'Nicholas Nisoff! Why did you shoot me?'"
</p>

<p>
When he had finished, Nicholas again wiped the
sweat from his brow and the major wrote down
something on a paper. The next day Nicholas was
taken away and brought to Berlin where he was
given employment on a railroad. He is much happier
now, and it is only now and then that the ghost
of the Hungarian woman comes to haunt him.
</p>

<p>
Helene Lichowitz! When they came for Ivan
Lichowitz, Helene begged them not to take her husband.
He was ill, she said. But it made no difference,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_285' name='Page_285'>285</a></span>
and three weeks later he was in the trenches.
Once he coughed so violently that he lost consciousness.
But when he came to, Helene Lichowitz was
bending over him.
</p>

<p>
"I have come to take care of you," she said. For
three weeks they were together. Helene did the
same work as a man, and most of Ivan's work too.
On a bitter cold day last December there was a
night attack by the Germans. The Russians were
ordered to charge. Ivan stumbled along blindly,
and Helene supported him when she thought that he
was going to fall. When they had gone a little way,
there was a great roar from the German side, followed
by a volley of bullets, shells burst in the air.
</p>

<p>
In the evening the German ambulance men came
to save what they could of the poor creatures lying
there. Ivan was dead, but Helene was carried to
a field hospital. The German doctor did everything
he could to save her, but Helene Lichowitz did not
want to live. She said her work was done. In three
days she died, holding the hand of the tear-dimmed
German doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Ivan Lichowitz!" she called in a low voice, "I
come!"

<h2>
HOW AMERICANS WERE TREATED IN
GERMANY.
</h2>

<p>
"Wilson Breaks with Germany!" So announced
the <i>B. Z. am Mittag</i> at noon on
Sunday February 5, 1917. It was a very cold day,
almost the coldest of that long cold winter. The
chills were running up and down my spine in our
cold apartment, but this headliner froze me stiff.
</p>

<p>
"Wilson Breaks with Germany." That is a typical
German headliner. They never say "America"
in the German papers, but always "Wilson," and it
is Wilson that gets the blame for everything and
never the American people.
</p>

<p>
The Monday after the break occurred the Americans
flocked around the Embassy. We were all
tremendously excited. Some were talking about
"getting out" and others about "staying over." All
were saying something, but most of us were saying
"We will wait and see." When war was really declared,
we took it much more calmly, we had grown
used to emotion.
</p>

<p>
Our breaking off relations was taken very quietly
by the German people. It was not flattering, and I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287'>287</a></span>
felt that they should show a little horror and emotion
that the greatest country in the world was
against them. But the German people are sort of
stunned in their emotions, and the only real emotion
they have is the wish for peace. Peace is all they
think about and long for.
</p>

<p>
When our Embassy went away all the Americans
that remained behind went to the station to see them
off. It was a slushy, snowy night. German policemen
were everywhere and we had to show our
passes to get out to the train. The platform was full
of people, and the people who were going away were
leaning from the train windows. Mr. and Mrs.
Gerard had a little crowd around their window. I
saw two men from the German Foreign Office in the
crowd, Dr. Roediger and Herr Horstmann. Dr.
Roediger was the clever young German who censored
most of the articles of the American newspaper
correspondents. His English was perfect.
</p>

<p>
When the train pulled out, there was a faint
"Hurrah," and the people turned down the steps,
embassyless and ambassadorless.
</p>

<p>
Right after the break Herr Zimmermann gave
out that the Americans in Germany should be shown
every courtesy, and that they should be treated as
neutrals, and that any discourtesy should be reported
to him at once.
</p>

<p>
Nothing happened to us until about the first of
April all the Americans were summoned to the Military
Commandery, and here we were lined up and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288'>288</a></span>
registered. The <i><span lang="de_DE">Militär</span></i> advised us to go home. The
Foreign Office too gave us this advice. Even the
American men were advised to leave, and none of
them were held.
</p>

<p>
The last of April the Americans got notices that
they would have to report to their local police every
day to get official papers stamped. Also that they
could not go from one city to another without a special
permit which took three weeks to get, also that
they could not go to the suburbs of Berlin without a
permit&mdash;this last included <span lang="de_DE">Grunewald</span>. The only
bright spot was that we could stay out at night as
late as we liked.
</p>

<p>
But for most Americans this did not last long,
and they got off with reporting only once a week,
and some of them had permanent permits for going
to certain places in the suburbs of Berlin. As I was
expecting to leave Germany, I never asked for one
of these permits, for it was an awful task to go to
the Military Commandery for anything, because
there were always so many people there waiting, it
took half a day to get anything. But I got off from
going to the police every day. No Americans were
allowed to go to either Potsdam or Spandau, Potsdam
because of the royal residences, and Spandau
because of the military stores. If you went any
place without a permit, you were fined twenty marks
and were liable to imprisonment.
</p>

<p>
I lived at a boarding-house where there were a
lot of German officers, and on all the excursions
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289'>289</a></span>
that were made to the country by the boarders, I
was asked to go along. The officers were very nice
men, and they said that they would protect me if
anything was said about my not having a permit,
but I never went with them, for I don't look like a
German and I was afraid I would be caught. I always
stayed within the law.
</p>

<p>
I lived at that boarding-house seven weeks just
before I left Germany, and I can honestly say that
I never heard a word against my country. When
I first went there I felt worried, for I was afraid
that they would say things to me about America,
and that I would answer back and maybe I would
get into trouble and be arrested and held in Germany.
But nothing like that happened. We hardly
ever talked war&mdash;no one in Germany talks war as
we do here in America&mdash;we talked about things to
eat.
</p>

<p>
At this boarding-house I made friends with a
very nice little German girl. One day we were
talking and she said to me, "You and I have become
very good friends. I never would have made up
with you if you had been an English girl, but we
Germans have no hate for America." And I have
found this true of most of the German people&mdash;I
am not speaking of the high officials and the big
<i><span lang="de_DE">Militär</span></i>, for I don't know anything about their sentiments&mdash;but
the German folks, they have no hatred
for us.
</p>

<p>
Amelia, the boarding-house maid, astonished me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290'>290</a></span>
one day by asking if America was in the war. When
I told her "yes" she wanted to know on which side,
and when I told her she said, "<i>Donnerwetter</i>, we
have so many enemies, I can't keep track of them.
But I want to go to America, and I am going there
after the war."
</p>

<p>
Every place I went I met Germans who want to
come to America after the war; every man on the
police force where I reported wants to come.
</p>

<p>
All the time all sorts of reports were being spread
in America. My family heard that I was being held
as a hostage, and another report was that an American
lady in Dresden had been shot as a spy. The
lady was called up by Mr. Oswald Schuette, an
American correspondent, and the lady herself answered
the phone. It was the first she had heard
of it.
</p>

<p>
Personally I never heard of an American that was
mistreated. I heard of one American that did a lot
of blowing and talking, and he was forced to report
to the police twice a day, and he had to be in at eight
o'clock at night, but when he got a passage for
America he was allowed to leave the country. All
the American business houses were open as usual,
and no American property was destroyed and no
money was confiscated. Of course one has the feeling
that one is in an enemy's land when one has to
go to the police every week, and it did get on my
nerves. And yet, every one was nice to me, and I
was there five months after the break.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_291' name='Page_291'>291</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The German people have the greatest faith in
their undersea-boats and the majority believe that
the war will be over before America really gets into
it. To them America seems far away. They don't
know our power and our might, and they are hoping,
hoping that the war will be over soon. Ask any
German when the war will be over and the answer
is, "In two months from now." "It can't last,"
they say.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' name='Page_292'>292</a></span>
</p>

<h2>
I LEAVE GERMANY, JULY 1, 1917.
</h2>

<p>
It is easier to cross the frontier going out of Germany
than any other frontier in Europe. This
statement includes neutral Denmark where they
nearly tore my clothes off me searching for gold.
You are not allowed to take any gold out of Denmark.
There are two reasons why the German
frontier is easy to cross. One is, that most people
who come out of Germany are anxious to come out,
and they are afraid to hide anything for if it was
found they would be sent back and held. The second
reason is that the Germans don't give suspicious
persons a permit to leave the country.
</p>

<p>
The day before you arrive at the German frontier
the officials there know all about you. They know
the history of your life and every move you have
made in Germany. They know whether you are to
be well searched or to be put through a form of
searching. At the frontier they ask you no questions,
for everything has been sent to them by the
military commandery in Berlin. An American newspaper
man in Copenhagen told me, that if the man
at the door of the searching-room at the frontier
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' name='Page_293'>293</a></span>
gives you a low number you are to be well searched,
and if you are given a high number you are hardly
searched at all.
</p>

<p>
It takes at least three weeks for a foreigner&mdash;neutral
or enemy&mdash;to get a permit to leave Germany;
that is unless you have influence, and then it
can be done in a few days. But that influence has
to be a powerful one, for the military authorities are
very strict.
</p>

<p>
The regular way to get the permit is to make a
formal application at your local police. This application
must be very politely written. I wrote out my
application so, "<i><span lang="de_DE">Ich ersuche um Erlaubnis, nach
Amerika zu gehen.</span></i>" My local policeman was horrified
at this. "It is not polite enough," he said,
"you must take it home and write it over." So I
wrote beginning like this, "Honorable Gentlemen,
I beg politely to have the honor to ask your gracious
permission to leave Germany, etc." This letter made
a great hit with the policeman.
</p>

<p>
After waiting a while, and if the police find that
you have a clean record, you get a notice to come to
the military commandery on a certain day. There
you find your permit or <i><span lang="de_DE">Passierschein</span></i> waiting for
you. The soldier in charge asks you what day you
wish to leave and then he gives you a day before
that date and a day after that date&mdash;three days upon
which you can travel.
</p>

<p>
Then the soldier takes a stack of papers&mdash;about
twenty sheets, and puts them&mdash;with your pass, four
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' name='Page_294'>294</a></span>
photographs and your permit ticket&mdash;in an envelope
and tells you to go to the police headquarters. Then
your running around commences, and it takes you
at least two days to get all the necessary stamps
and seals. Then the evening before you leave the
country you must go to your local police and register.
If you should forget to do this you would be
sent back from the frontier.
</p>

<p>
You are not allowed to take with you any writing
of any kind, or printed matter, books etc., out of
Germany without having them first censored. They
have a place where the letters are read and sealed,
and if you have a lot of books they send a soldier to
your house. He looks over the books and packs
your trunk and then seals it, and it is not opened
again at the frontier. You pay the soldier one mark
an hour for the work.
</p>

<p>
You are not allowed to take anything that Germany
might need, out of Germany&mdash;no tools, no instruments
and no electrical apparatus; that is, if the
things have been bought in Germany. If it is something
of a foreign make you can take it with you.
</p>

<p>
I had a little electric stove that I was very fond
of, and I knew that if I ever went to the frontier
with that stove they would take it away from me in
a minute, as it was new and German make. I went
to an influential man I knew in the Foreign Office
and I asked him if he would seal up my stove for
me. He laughed but said, "The German Foreign
Office can't seal up a stove." I was disappointed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_295' name='Page_295'>295</a></span>
but not daunted, and I inveigled the military division
of the Foreign Office to help me in getting a
permit to take my stove over the border.
</p>

<p>
You are allowed to take one thousand marks out
of Germany, so I got all my money over that amount
changed into Swedish money. I took it to Dr. Roediger,
the censor, and asked him to seal it for me.
</p>

<p>
"How many marks have you?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No marks at all," I answered, "that is Swedish
money." As he was a nice, sensible, clever man,
he asked no more questions but sealed it for me.
</p>

<p>
It was Sunday when I left Berlin. The train was
almost empty. I had my money in my hand grip,
and in the other hand I had my precious stove which
had a case like a kodak. At Rostock a man came
through the train and asked to see our passports.
He only looked at the passports of the Germans in
the coupé with me, but he took my pass and wrote a
long list about it on a slip of paper. The people in
the coupé stared at me.
</p>

<p>
At noon we came to Warnemünde. At the door
of the military customs we were given a number.
Mine was "J 19." Then we went into a room where
a soldier called out the numbers. There were only
about thirty of us in all, I was the only enemy&mdash;the
rest were Germans and Danes. When the man called
"J 19" I handed him my pass and my permit. "Oh,
a <i><span lang="de_DE">Passierschein</span></i>." he said. The passes were shoved
through a little slot in the wall, and as soon as our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296'>296</a></span>
pass examination was through, we were let into a
room where our baggage was examined.
</p>

<p>
As I entered the room, a soldier stepped forward.
He had my pass in his hand. "What is your name?"
he asked, and that question was the only question
that I was asked when I crossed the frontier out of
Germany.
</p>

<p>
A soldier in a black uniform opened my trunk
first. I showed him the permit I had for the stove.
He looked at the sealed packages and then he passed
me on to another soldier in gray. This soldier took
the wrapping off all my sealed packages, and then
he asked me if I had any other writing or books in
my trunk, and when I said, "No," he closed the trunk
again without taking one thing out of it or looking
at it at all. This man spoke rather good English,
and when I asked him where he had learned it he
answered, "Talking to little American children that
I know."
</p>

<p>
Then he told me that I would have to be searched
and he gave me the number "91." He carried my
baggage to the dressing-room for me. Here a
woman searched me. I had to take off my skirt and
waist and shoes, but I was not torn apart, and the
searching was anything but thorough. When I
came out I was given my pass again and told I could
get on the boat. The whole performance did not
take more than fifteen minutes.
</p>

<p>
On the boat I had to have my baggage searched
again by the Danish officials, but this was merely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297'>297</a></span>
a farce, for they knew well enough that nobody was
trying to export anything out of Germany. The
dinner on the Warnemünde boat was wonderful&mdash;everything
possible and without a card. We all sat
down and ate and ate and ate. After dinner, lovely
girls came around selling the most wonderful strawberries.
But when we were out about an hour the
sea got very rough. Afterwards we left the boat
and boarded a train on the island. Before the train
started we all stood in the corridor of the train
looking at the boat we had just left. It was all
spattered down the sides with red. Our thoughts
were all the same, and then in the silence, the piping
voice of a little German girl was heard, "<i><span lang="de_DE">Wie schade
um die Erdbeeren!</span></i>" And we all echoed her thoughts,
"Too bad about the strawberries."
